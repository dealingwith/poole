## Oddities, Obscurities & Obscenities
<time class="post-date">January 2016</time>

[Oddities, Obscurities & Obscenities](https://lousyrobot.bandcamp.com/album/oddities-obscurities-obscenities):

> In May 2015, Jim Phillips, singer and mastermind behind Lousy Robot, unexpectedly passed away. Before his death Jim and the band had been working on collecting outtakes and rarities from previous recording sessions in hopes of putting out a collection of weirdness titled _Oddities, Obscurities & Obscenities_. 

The collection included three covers. I recorded a cover of _Peacocks_. I also designed the cover image.

## Skeleton Closet
<time class="post-date">August 2015</time>

My producer, Salim Nourallah, covered my song _[This Town](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/this-town)_ for his record _Skeleton Closet_. He also used my song _[It's a Good Day](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/its-a-good-day)_ as the basis for his track _Andalucia in the Spring_.

## Form
<time class="post-date">October 2013</time>

My most recent studio recording. _Form_ is a record of (mostly) cover songs, performed by (mostly) other people. After my daughter Margot died, I found myself no longer with an artistic voice to help make meaning out of the meaningless, but a need and desire for the same. So I asked my friends to help, and found bits and pieces of the story in others' songs. More information on [the Bandcamp page](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/album/form).

<time class="post-date">January 2011</time>

The Reamericana EP is a remastered combination of a previous EP, _<a href="#AmericanaEP">The Americana EP</a>_, and songs that did not make it onto _<a href="#hsss">Happy Sounding Sad Songs</a>_. [More info here](http://danielsjourney.com/2011/01/24/reamericana.html).

## Memorial
<time class="post-date">November 2010</time>

On Tuesday, August 17th many dear friends of ours gathered to remember our perfect, precious Margot Rose Miller. There to perform in her honor were Chris Holt, Salim Nourallah, Doug Burr and The Beaten Sea. This record is a collection of the songs they played for her, in the acoustic style in which they were played that night. [More info here](http://www.danielsjourney.com/2010/11/21/chris.html).

## Wake Up John
<time class="post-date">December 2009</time>

My friend Jon Broom was in a motorcycle accident on September 5, 2009 and suffered a severe brain injury. At the time we started writing and recording this song, he was still in a coma. We recorded this song to help his family during that time.

## Americana EP
<time class="post-date">September 2003</time>

Recorded in Sarajevo, BiH, during my short time there. I don't have this record online, mostly because I remastered most of the tracks for _<a href="#reamericana">Reamericana EP</a>_. Recorded under the name _Daniel Miller Band_.

## dealing with madness
<time class="post-date">1997</time>

My debut record. I have a couple mp3s on a hard drive somewhere, but no other evidence this record ever happened. For the best.

## Other projects

I facilitated in the recording and preserving of some other things. 

This is the only recording of _Escalator Maintenance Society_ that I know of.

I've made a lot of other mashups and mixtapes, but they were all very personal or contextual.
