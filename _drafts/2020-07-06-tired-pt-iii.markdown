[I had hoped that I'd licked the physical malaise](/2020/07/02/tired/) I'd been experiencing for weeks. But it's going to require some additional experimentation and iteration. I'm just jotting down ideas while I'm having them.

* Continue to focus on blood oxygen as potential culprit.
* I'm curious why riding my bike in the morning is a big energy booster the majority of the time, but over time loses it's power and actually becomes a negative. This would normally be an obvious case of "over training", but my bike riding these days can hardly be considered training. In fact, I ride shorter and slower _specifically for the energy boost_. My level of "training" should be sustainable indefinitely. 
* Sleep deprivation is certainly a thing. I typically get six hours of sleep--midnight to six am. This is not enough for my body, obviously, because I tend to crash hard on weekend. 
  * Typical schedule:
    * 6 am: Wakeup
    * 6:30: On bike. If no bike ride, usually sat at my computer during this time doing low-key work and planning my day
    * 8: Shower and eat
    * 9: Work
    * 6 pm: Dinner with family
    * 7 pm: Either work or hang out with family
    * 9 pm: Put kids to bed
    * 10 pm: Low-key work like email
    * 11 pm: Hang out with wife
    * 12 am: Go to bed
  * A young single coworker told me about how he gets eight hours of sleep per night. I thought about that frequently. Then another coworker told me he also gets eight hours a night. I haven't thought about it since. I could not work out or not spend time with my wife. I don't really want to give up either of those things.
* Diet.
