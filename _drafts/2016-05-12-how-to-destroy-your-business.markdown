  * Make your physical office an open plan style
  * Pipe music throughout the office
  * Do everything customers want you to
  * Do not have a clear vision for your product to begin with (makes the former easier)
  * Interrupt your employees frequently, especially for information that's already been captured in shared communication systems
  * Make emotional decisions but change your emotional state frequently
  * Don't budget
  * Nickel and dime your employees over quality of life issues
  * Nag over scheduling issues
