My two tools are Trello and [PlainTasks](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks), a [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com/) format plugin for Sublime Text. I use the latter for all the notes I take on my computer, I basically have two very large TaskPaper files, one personal and one for the day job. Every day I create a list of the things I plan on getting done that day. 

Trello is my capture tool. The Android app has a quick-add widget, which I use multiple times per day. Any task or note gets captured into my *backlog* list, then I process that list on a regular basis. 

Trello is also my longer-than-today task planning tool. I use it like a traditional kanban, with *backlog*, *working* and *done* lists.

To occasionally bridge these two worlds, I created a [Ruby script](https://github.com/dealingwith/trellopaper) that imports certain Trello lists and creates a TaskPaper file from them.
