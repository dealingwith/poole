I'm all for standardization of design. My own personal design tendencies have been heavily influenced by [Swiss Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Typographic_Style) and [modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism) after all. But it seems like the state of web application design in 2020 is one of homogeneity to the point of boredom. I was perusing [uidesigndaily.com](https://uidesigndaily.com/) and struck my how every element is the same. Google used to be known for having particularly _bad_ design, then they got all grown up and improved their designs almost across the board; but now, particularly with [Material](https://material.io/), they're contributing to the mass assimilation of all web design into one big institutional blob. (I am currently using Material icons for the nav icons on this blog.)
