Inspired by [this Roderick on the Line episode](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-318-the-best-chicken.html), here are some famous people I have met under various circumstances:

**People I have met and have embarrassed myself in front of**

Steward Butterfield

**People I have met very briefly and didn't really appreciate at the time**

Reggie Watts

**People I have have met and kind-of already knew via the Internet**

[Peter Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hughes_(musician))

**Big "other" bucket**
