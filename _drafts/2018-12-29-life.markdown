It was a musical Christmas.

We also got a Switch. Milo and I are trying to figure out Minecraft. I am old, so figuring out all the commands on the controller is quite the learning curve. Milo (4) will quickly be more proficient than I in this version of Minecraft. 

It's been a very relaxing holiday for us. I very much needed the time to reconnect with my family and just have a mental break from my normal, hectic work life.

I've struggled with acceptance this year but I feel like I'm having some small breakthroughs here at the end of the year. It's a good time to reflect, as always. I still frequently feel restless, like I need to be _doing_ something, but I'm finally learning that it is more often best to do nothing, at least at first. I'm not in control, and that's ok.
