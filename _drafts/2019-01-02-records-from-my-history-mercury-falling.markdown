For some reason the tune _Valparaiso_ came to mind yesterday. I hadn't listened to _Mercury Falling_ in a _long_ time. Upon listening to it this morning, I realized just how much of my strange personal history was tied up in this record.

Of course, saying anything good about this record, even this artist, will lose me a lot of points within many circles. Such is life.

The first thing I'll say about this record is: Dominic Miller--guitar; Kenny Kirkland--keyboards; Vinnie Colaiuta--drums; Branford Marsalis-â€“saxophone. That lineup speaks for itself.
