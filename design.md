# Daniel Miller

### Technology leader, designer, front-end developer

I am passionate about the craft of software development. I believe good design comes from a focus on _how it works_ not just _how it looks_. I believe simplicity is the most important component of quality design. [email](mailto:dealingwith@gmail.com) / [blog](http://danielsjourney.com) / [github](https://github.com/dealingwith)
