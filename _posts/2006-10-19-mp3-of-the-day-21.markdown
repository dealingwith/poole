I mentioned them and posted a YouTube video [before][1]. I had a tassle of
other songs that had stuff to do with my real life. But this record came in
the mail today so I had to share.

This is an emo hip hop act, essentially. And you know I'm a sucker for good
hooks and beats when they can use my most-hated phrase-of-the-moment* and I
still like the song:

[Gym Class Heroes - New Friend Request][2]

> on a scale of 1 to awesome i'm the shit


* "in your/my top eight"[![][3]][4]

[The Queen and I][5]

> She makes the cutest faces when she screams obscenities And slurs her words
because she's never not inebriated

...that's my second mp3-of-the-day about drinking lately. huh.

and the fantastically named [Ok, But Just This Once!][6]

> We put the F-U in fun

yeah. i have doubts that this is some kind of mid-life crisis. but i like the
music too much to care all that much.
