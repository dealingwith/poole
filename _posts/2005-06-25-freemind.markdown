[FreeMind][1]


> FreeMind is a premier free mind-mapping software written in Java. The recent
development has hopefully turned it into high productivity tool. We are proud
that the operation and navigation of FreeMind is faster than that of
MindManager because of one-click "fold / unfold" and "follow link" operations.
