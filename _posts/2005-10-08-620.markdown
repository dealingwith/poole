_Webloggers of 1999 don't equal bloggers in 2005. I really need to accept it
and move on. I recently found out that a few people had migrated to
LiveJournal (yes, LiveJournal. Really!) because they could set controls on who
could read and have more freedom to write about things they didn't want etched
in Google for eternity.

I was kind of shocked when saw the names of people who were on it. It's like
when you're wandering around the party thinking people had gone home and then
you find them all in the back-room smoking pot and giggling at a television
that isn't even on.

Anyway, I guess I've been wandering around the party these days. All the
people I used to read didn't get boring, they just found someplace else to
hang out (and didn't tell me! jerks)._ [torrez][1]
