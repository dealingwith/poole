Up very early for reasons I need not bore you with I ended up reading [Spector 45](/2011/01/08/frankie/) Facebook pages and someone had posted about this film and I clicked the "watch a clip" button and the last bit of this video I'm posting here made me cry [again](/2011/06/13/best-worst-of-times/). Made me say "Yes, yes, yes" through my tears again.
