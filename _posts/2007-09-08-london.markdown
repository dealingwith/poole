[Shiny][3]

Originally uploaded by [ngc1039][4]

{For chronological accuracy, I had back-dated posts about [Greenbelt][5],
[Wales][6], and [Ireland][7], which means they didn't get into the RSS feed
(near as I can tell). I'm not backdating the rest, in part to avoid that issue
and also to have a record of how mad things have been since my return. I still
have all the post-Greenbelt photos to process!}

Mon (Sept 3) 17:15

At the [National Gallery][8] but my body, particularly my eyes, have given
out; and, only 15 minutes until I walk around to the offices to pick up Jen
and find someplace to meet [Steve][9] for drinks (and I could eat despite
having had breakfast and lunch).

I thought it interesting I went from the [Design Museum][10] to the [Tate
Modern][11] to the National Gallery -- from the most specific to the least,
and my excitement and interest inversely relate to that.

(In my notebook I drew a graph. I was going to recreate the graphic for this
post. It's not going to happen. Use your imagination.)

But damn. I do love art.

  * Art has a particular smell, one that takes me back to the gallery days and
of course, unfortunately, a person

  * Saw so many similarities, where Dallas artists are derivative (but still
amazing). One obvious one: Dan Flavin -> [Tim Stokes ][16]

  * Saw _Dali and Film_ but was a little underwhelmed, except for the process
it revealed

  * Dragging myself out of the Tate gift shop. Seeing the same book I wanted
three years ago--[_A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History_][17]--and making a
note to get it from Amazon and read it. (Did get it.) Resisting a [Tate
mug][18].

  * Seeing [Andy Budd][19] at the Design Museum

  * [Both][20] [exhibits][21] at the Design Museum

  * Zubaran's St. Francis paintings at the National Gallery
