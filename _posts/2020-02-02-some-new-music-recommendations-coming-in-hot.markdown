[I Built the Sky](https://www.ibuiltthesky.com/) reminds me of a heavier Covet, [who I mentioned last year](/2019/02/04/covet/). They're from Australia. The track above from not their newest record is the one I'm totally obsessed with at the moment. The drums sound fantastic and as a drummer first (songwriter second), I enjoy music where the drums can be in service of the music but still shred.

Here is a big rock video from them:

I've talked about this artist before, but he has a new project, with possibly [the best domain name I've seen in a while](https://www.jointheexistence.com/).

He has a new [patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/christinnelson/posts). It's worth it for the wit.

You can buy [Michael Bell](https://michaelpatrickbell.bandcamp.com/)'s discography for $21.50, which is 15¢ a song, which is stealing. I can even attest to the fact you'll also receive a thank you email from Michael himself.
