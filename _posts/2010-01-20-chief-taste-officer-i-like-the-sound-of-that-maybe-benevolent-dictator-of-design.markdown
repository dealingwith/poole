> Hire a GOD of UX, not a pixel pusher.


Maybe call them the Chief Taste Officer. You’re looking for someone who is
equal parts Steve Jobs, Don Draper, and Seth Godin. Assuming such a person
exists (and that you can hire them) they will be responsible for Quality, top
to bottom, and they’ll have the power (hiring, budget, creative authority,
whatever it takes) to make it happen.


This is a pretty tall order. It may even be impossible. Apple was able to do
it, but only because Steve Jobs is a genius who wanted his baby back, and
Apple was circling the drain so Jobs was given the time and authority he
needed to remake the company.

Also:

> We’re not all solo auteurs. Collaboration, compromise, and constraints are
inescapable when building complicated products. The secret is to make sure
that even as work is distributed, ownership of the work’s quality isn’t.


If you’re a software company, your people should have titles like these:


God of Bringing in the Money

God of Servers

God of Programming

God of the User Experience


Show me a company without a designated (and opinionated) “God of UX” and I’ll
show you a company that makes crap.
