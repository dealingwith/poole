[ARGN: Ares Station Completes Its Mission][1]

> ![aresstation.jpg][2]The indie Alternate Reality Game [Ares Station][3] came
to a close on May 5th, with an announcement on its [trailhead page][4].
Although nobody likes it when a game ends, those who played the two-month long
ARG seemed to be extremely happy with the game overall.

>

> Ares Station was designed by [Indiana University Bloomington][5] graduate
students Nathan Mishler and Will Emigh as a Telecommunications thesis project.
Ares Station represents about a year of work, and included excellent quality
design and multimedia elements, as well as a very effective "stealth" launch.
