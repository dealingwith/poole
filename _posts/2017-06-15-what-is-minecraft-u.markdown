[Keith Hanson](http://twinenginelabs.com/) has taken the Minecraft U ball and [run with it in Shreveport](https://www.minecraftu-shreveport.com/). Last night he recorded this demonstration of both redstone and ComputerCraft. I was his silent assistant, helping him escape a locked tower after his own invention locked him inside.
