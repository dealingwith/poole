This is my website, and my blog, and I can say what the fuck I want to on it.



The people who read my blog are a part of my extended community. Some of them have reached out to me in incredibly meaningful ways.



No one has anything to fear from the truth. However it does take courage and humility to admit to and accept our own humanness. 



I will honor your request, however.



In the meantime it sucks to be human, and I hope all my readers might understand that, even those for whom this whole human existance thing is going really well right now, even you.



In the meantime I will still be mourning the loss of something that was always bigger than me, something so precious and tenuous, like life itself, beautiful. This blog is one of things I use to process that loss. I'm sorry if it offends you, but that isn't an apology.
