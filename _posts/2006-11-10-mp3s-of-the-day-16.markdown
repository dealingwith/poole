[![][1]Drumming mix][2] (84M ZIP). This week I set up my drums and began
practicing in anticipation of recording drums all day in the studio tomorrow.
Despite recording all the drums on the record so far, and not doing too shabby
a job if I do say so myself, I'm really rusty. And it's funny what gets sore
first from drumming: my big toe, because I play without shoes, and my left
hand, because I play [traditional grip][3] ([eg][4]).

Anyway, this is a mix I put together for myself to get warmed up and try to
recover some of the chops I've lost. It's probly not the kind of music a
proper hipster would listen to, but I'm not even an unproper hipster, and this
stuff **gooves**.
