[Hurry Slowly--003: Craig Mod--I Want My Attention Back!](http://hurryslowly.co/003-craig-mod/)

> If there was a meter of 1 to 10 of how present you are or how much you can manipulate your own attention--how confident you are that you could, say, read a book for three hours without an interruption, without feeling pulled to something else. I would say the baseline pre-smartphone was a 4 or 3. Now, it’s a 1.

> I think that a life in which you are never present, in which you have no control over your attention, in which you’re constantly being pulled in different directions, is kind of sad--because there is this incredible gift of consciousness. And when that consciousness is deployed smartly, it’s amazing the things that can be built out of it.

[Ashamed to work in Silicon Valley: how techies became the new bankers](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/08/ashamed-to-work-in-silicon-valley-how-techies-became-the-new-bankers)

> The focus of Silicon Valley used to be innovation with the wonderful bonus of money on the side of that, but those two things seem to have switched--just as the pencil-pushing mentality of finance in the 70s became the champagne lifestyle in the 2000s.

> People have come to have too much swagger and not enough insights.

> You are selling ads, you’re not really making the world a better place

> You wake up, get the shuttle bus, go to the bubble of campus and order food via an app when you get home. You are not a citizen, just a bizarre leech who makes money.

[Tim Berners-Lee on the future of the web: 'The system is failing'](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/15/tim-berners-lee-world-wide-web-net-neutrality)

> I’m still an optimist, but an optimist standing at the top of the hill with a nasty storm blowing in my face, hanging on to a fence

> The system is failing. The way ad revenue works with clickbait is not fulfilling the goal of helping humanity promote truth and democracy. So I am concerned.

> We are so used to these systems being manipulated that people just think that’s how the internet works. We need to think about what it should be like
