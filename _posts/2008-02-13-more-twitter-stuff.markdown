A fairly comprehensive list of what Twitter is from "[A MSc research on the
one thing Twitter asks; what are you doing?][1]"

> Twitter is more a network than an application. If you ask around you will
notice that most people are using different interfaces on different platforms
and clients. Because of the API connecting to the network adapts to your
preferred way of working.


Twitter

>

>   * Is easy accessible

>   * Is live

>   * Forces you to focus

>   * Is broken conversation

>   * Is open conversation

>   * Is spam free, like RSS (subscription based)

>   * Is a network

>   * Is synchronous / asynchronous

>   * Is a black hole

>   * Is a time capsule

>   * Is a centralized network

>   * Changes public / privacy

>   * Is a knowledge base

>   * Is very unstable

>   * Is making it very difficult for search engines

>   * Is platform independent

...And some recent [Twitter apps and news I've bookmarked][2]:

  * [Qwitter][3] helps track how much you smoke in order to help you quit

  * [Commuter Feed][4] puts traffic reporting in the hands of the people

  * [Twitter Karma][5] lets you know which of your Twitter connections are
mutual

  * [Thumbs Race as Japan's Best Sellers Go Cellular (New York Times)][6]: "Of
last yearâ€™s 10 best-selling novels, five were originally cellphone novels,
mostly love stories written in the short sentences characteristic of text
messaging but containing little of the plotting or character development found
in traditional novels." This is a Twitter app waiting to happen, there are
already sites in .jp that help capture cellphone novels.

  * [Tweetgift][7] lets you send virtual gifts to friends over Twitter

  * [plusplus bot][8] lets you rate things quickly over Twitter

I have exactly three Twitter apps on my todo list, but one I would love to
have now and not have to figure out the vagaries of: Stayawayfromme allows you
to be alerted whenever someone you _do not_ want to run into reports that they
are at a particular location. There are more social problems with this app,
however--primarily, it requires mutual agreement on the exclusion and could be
subverted with no effort (i.e. it could also be "Stalkme"). For now, I'm
"[tracking][9]" a couple key location names, but I'm not sure if I'll receive
the updates if I have the person blocked as well. Ah, the complications of
technologically-enhanced social graphs!
