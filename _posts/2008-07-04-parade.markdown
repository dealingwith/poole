[Parade][3]

Originally uploaded by [carissabyers][4]

Was curious what I looked like, riding my fixie down the road with a dog
attached. [He][5] survived [about a mile run each way][6] in the heat and
caused me very little stress; he is trained to stay on my left which means he
tried to pass behind me a couple of times after finding himself to my right,
but mostly he stayed in front or just off to my left, neither pulling or
crossing my path. [#][7]
