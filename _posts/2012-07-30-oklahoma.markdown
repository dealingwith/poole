Last weekend my sister, nephews, Carissa, Penn, Lucy, Pavlov and Ringo piled clown-car style into a rented Suburban and drove to Oklahoma to visit family and celebrate a 95th birthday. Lucy met a lot of new people and handled it great. Pavlov swam for the first time in his life (he's 9) and the dogs got to be dogs for the first time in a long time. Penn had fun every waking minute. On our way from the city back to "the farm" Saturday night he asked out of the blue, "Can we move to Oklahoma?"
