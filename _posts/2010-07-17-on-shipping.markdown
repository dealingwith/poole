<a class="dead">_You've either shipped or you haven't_ (dead link)</a>. At first this post seemed really pretentious, but its main point (above) is spot on. People who haven't actually finished something are the most likely to criticize those who have.

One of the things that has really been holding me back lately isn't the shipping, it's the fear of what might not happen after I've shipped. Attention is scarse these days. So is decent software.
