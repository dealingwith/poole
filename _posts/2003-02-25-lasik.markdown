i still haven't decided if i'm going to get the eye surgery, which if it is going to happen before we leave needs to be decided upon SOON, but right now, this very second?, <a href="http://www.vsdar.de/english/lasik/ablauf.html">having part of one's eyeball cut open and then having a laser shot into it</a> just seems a lot worse then <a href="http://www.perret-optic.ch/Lentille_de_contact/Prod_entretients/Prod_entretien_images/prod_entret_vch_mettre_2.jpg">touching one's eyeball</a> or <a href="http://hcs.harvard.edu/~alhuang/anime/thoughts/gendoug.jpg">touching the spot between one's eyes</a> all day.
