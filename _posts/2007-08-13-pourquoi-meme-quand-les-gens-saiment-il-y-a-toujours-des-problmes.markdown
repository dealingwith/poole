[![][1]][2]Listening to a lot of Manu Chao this morning:

[Je ne t'aime plus][3] (Oh how I wish it were true. I don't think he means it
when he sings it, either, though.)

[Mentira][4] (Indeed.)

(Title of this post not from either of these, but rather from _La Vie a Deux_,
which you will just have to go get your own self.) ([Esperanza][5] is also
very good.)
