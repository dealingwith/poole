continuing with the sharing of my conspicuous consumption of late... i bought
three over the rhine cd's the other day, bringing my OtR obsession to scary
new heights...

[Grey Ghost Stories][1], one of Linford's solo cd's, [Unspoken Requests][2],
another, and [The Cutting Room Floor][3], a "musical directorâ€™s commentary" of
demos and live recordings from the Films for Radio time period.

[![][4]From Grey Ghost Stories][1], [I Was Thinking the Same Thing][5]

[![][6]From Unspoken Requests][2], [Winter Wedding][7]. Ironically, both these
records are piano records, and the two songs I choose to share are two of the
few that are not piano-based.

[![][8]From The Cutting Room Floor][3], [Helpless (live)][9], a Neil Young
cover featuring the help of Buddy and Julie Miller.


yet more tomorrow...
