I just donated to the [Ada Initiative](http://adainitiative.org/) after reading [this Verge article](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/12/4693710/the-end-of-kindness-weev-and-the-cult-of-the-angry-young-man) ...I had EFF on my list to donate to, but I decided to send that money to the Ada Initiative instead. And if their preset donation amounts don't inspire you, you must not be a true nerd. :)
