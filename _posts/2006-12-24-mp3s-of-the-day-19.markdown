[![][1]

Advent Mix][2] (52M) A collection of songs about Waiting, featuring a lot of
Dallas acts. I guess we wait alot in Dallas. I'm waiting, and as [suggested in
this post][3], my waiting will not be fulfilled tomorrow. Mine has no defined
endpoint. It may never end. I just don't know.

[Daniel Miller - Cliche][4] A new song I recorded a home demo of.

[Daniel Miller - When I Go][5] (by Over the Rhine) A cover I also recently
recorded at home.
