> ...there is no substitute for your own voice. You must write. You must. You must write and it must be your own words. There is no other way. You must think into a text editor, and then use the text editor to get the text into the brains of your audience. There are no shortcuts to the act of original, well-considered writing.

A good reminder from [Nick Disabato](https://draft.nu/)'s [email newsletter](https://www.getdrip.com/deliveries/cxkqtzvg5g62z9syxoen).
