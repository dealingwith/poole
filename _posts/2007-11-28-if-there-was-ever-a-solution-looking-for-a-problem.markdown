![][1][Dear Jeff Bezos (one-week Kindle review) [Scobleizer]][2]. Good lord.
Yes, you are a geek. But the worst possible kind. There is a fine line between
"This suxs" and "Fire! Burn! Loot!"

And as for [one's reasons for wanting ebooks][3] go, those are horrible.

The book is going to be very hard to beat. Yes, the "Web" has killed _text_--
in the way of newspapers, fliers, instruction manuals, dictionaries and
encyclopedias--but in terms of the aesthetic a well-designed _book_ achieves
in terms of

  * Is typically a complete work

  * Requires no other device to consume

  * Utterly portable

  * A consummate consumable: Can be both held on to indefinitely or thrown
right in the trash

...it is going to be a long time before there is any technology that can beat
it. I mean, come ON: the image above is from Amazon's own promotional shots!
That's like advertising [Arial][4] by putting it right next to [Helvetica][5].

If anything, the return of [The Fray][6] as a paper publication is the best
content-tech news of the week.
