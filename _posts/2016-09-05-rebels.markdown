It should be clear if you follow the thread through those three sources above: we are losing the battle for not the just the web, but our own minds and humanity. It sounds hyperbolic, but it's important to at least consider. 

We've traded the open web of ideas, creativity and collaboration for a walled compound where we are trained by specialists on how to think, how to desire. We are [desiring machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Oedipus#Desiring_machines_and_social_production), tuned with algorithms and "[arguments supporting [our] views](http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=goldstone)". We use our hands not to respond with words, but with taps, each recorded and analyzed.

> The pirates have taken over the fleet, and those with discipline and old-world skills are hidden away in enclaves, quietly existing on the resources available to them.

Perhaps now that the pirates have taken over the fleet, the old admirals are the new pirates. And here we land on my Star Wars metaphor with full..._force_.

> [Technologies] make good toys, but terrible addictions...These media may be useful to our art--but they must not possess us, nor must they stand between, mediate, or separate us from [ourselves]. We want to control our media, not be Controlled by them. [#](http://hermetic.com/bey/radio_se.html)

So what do we do? I'm notorious for leaving multi-part blog series unfinished, but I will attempt to answer that question in Episode 2.
