[Search For Self Called Off After 38 Years][1]

_CHICAGO—The longtime search for self conducted by area man Andrew Speth was
called off this week, the 38-year-old said Monday.

"I always thought that if I kept searching and exploring, I'd discover who I
truly was," said Speth from his Wrigleyville efficiency. "Well, I looked deep
into the innermost recesses of my soul, I plumbed the depths of my
subconscious, and you know what I found? An empty, windowless room the size of
an aircraft hangar. From now on, if anybody needs me, I'll be sprawled out on
this couch drinking black-cherry soda and watching Law & Order like everybody
else."

"Fuck it," he added.

...Speth said he will no longer lament his coding job at Eagle Client
Services, but will rather "embrace the fact that I have a job that makes
enough money to pay for cable." Additionally, Speth has vowed to marry "the
first woman who will have me, whether I love her or not."

..."Trust me—there's nothing out there for you to find," Speth said. "You're
wasting your life. The sooner you realize you have no self to discover, the
sooner you can get on with what's truly important: celebrity magazines, snack
foods, and Internet porn." _
