Good Lord, [the music is really good too][1]...

> I don't wanna waste your time With music you don't need Why should I
autograph the book That you won't even read I've got a different scar for
every song And blood left still to bleed But I don't wanna waste your time
With music you don’t need

I don't wanna waste good wine If you won't stick around I love to laugh but
I'm more than just Your alcoholic clown

Come on lighten up Let me fill your cup I'm just trying to imagine a situation
Where we might have a real conversation

But I don't wanna waste the words That you don't seem to need When it comes to
wanting what's real There's no such thing as greed I hope this night puts down
deep roots I hope we plant a seed 'Cause I don't wanna waste your time With
music you don’t need

> We'd wake the dead With voices in our head We've gotten used to ignoring the
truth

We close our eyes And breathe and eat the lies That tell us we're so much
better than you

Silence is loud Humility is so proud Nothing is innocent now

> The way this works is so mysterious If it gets much worse it's called
delirious If I were mad I would be furious But this could be so much more than
Just another euphemism for...

I've been entertaining thoughts Of what I wanna say to you I've been
entertaining thoughts Of what I'm gonna do I've been saving what I got And
wondering who to give it to I've been entertaining thoughts all over you

You smoke your cigarette And wonder if it's happened yet The heavens slowly
part and you ascend I wish that I could say that I'll have no regrets But I
may have one of two Or three or four more than you...

You will never even know Till it hits you fool Ooh, but I'm entertaining
thoughts All over you

> Walk into the room with that curious grin Ain't nobody need to know the
actual shape I'm in But oh, who'm I kiddin' but me

Call you on the phone, I got nothin' to say Put my lips a little closer and
stand there anyway 'Cause oh, who'm I kiddin' but me

I hang from my desire Like a rope swing from a tree I kick a little higher
Singin' I Shall Be Released But oh, who'm I kiddin' but me

The devil's in the details

I'd like to get to know ya And shake the holy fire right out of you But oh,
who'm I kiddin' but me
