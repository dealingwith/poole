[![][1]][2]As some of you might remember, I'm [slightly obsessed with Miranda
July][3] ATM. I bought one of her CD's -- I figured I am planning on doing
spoken word stuff, so it was also good reference. It is amazing and weird at
the same time. I will let you judge for yourself with this the first track of
5 interweaving stories on [this record][2].
