> We procrastinate because we are afraid. We’re afraid it’s too much work and
that it will drain us. We’re afraid we’ll screw it up and get in trouble.
We’re afraid we don’t know how to do it. We’re afraid because, well, we’ve
been putting it off forever and every time we put it off it seems a little
more fearsome in our minds. That’s why not putting things off is so
liberating. We’re forced to confront our fears, not let them grow bigger by
repeatedly running away. And when we confront them, we find they’re not so
scary after all.
