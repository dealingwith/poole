It's not ok to be sad if it causes or excuses you to hurt or neglect others or yourself, or get angry or be manipulative. It's not ok to be sad if it is your reason for remaining a practicing alcoholic, or for keeping an extra bottle of pills in the cabinet. It's not ok to be sad if you have guns.

It's a wide, fog-covered space between where sadness ends and selfishness begins, but knowing when it has been crossed is an art of conscience we're all learning for the duration of our lifetimes. I have been on the wrong end of that space many times.

I'm re-reading [Riddell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Riddell)'s [Sacred Journey](https://books.google.com/books?id=3G2pAwAAQBAJ) for what I thought was the third time; [but in 2004 I claimed to be reading it for the third time]({{ base.url }}/2004/08/15/Wanting-to-change-the-world-is-not-a-noble-calling-its-a-primal-calling.html#riddell) which would make this the fifth. I turn to this tome like others turn to the Bible or the Quran. I like that I can actually email the author.

I was quoting from it again [a year later]({{ base.url }}/2005/07/11/i-hope-theres-grace-in-this-town.html) during time of crisis. 

As you might guess, this is another time of crisis.

More Riddell quotes appearing on this blog is likely. But I'll try not to repeat myself.
