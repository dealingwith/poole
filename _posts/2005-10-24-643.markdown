_why does the thought of revival scare me? isn't it what christians are
supposed to be praying for, that our society should turn to god? the problem
is, all the images in my head are creepy. religious mania. weeping and wailing
in the streets. censorship. rigidity and punishment. zealous preachers. fear
god and cast out the sinners. enforced niceness.

how come 'revival' never means good coffee and free wifi, everywhere? really
challenging and confrontational art? the development of cheap sustainable
technology? an end to greed and overwork? a good wage for the [formerly] poor?
what would a holy, as opposed to religious, society look like?_
