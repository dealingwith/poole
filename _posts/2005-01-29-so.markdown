In the last 24 hours I've gone from feeling the least lonely I've ever felt to the most lonely I've ever felt. It's not the latter that is so difficult as it is the transition.



In the past week and a half, I've lost most of my hope in both Christ, as guide, and humanity, as helper.



I'm beginning to think we're in dark times.



I'm still not telling you what's going on, am I?



In other news, the dog got into just about everything tonight while I was gone, and puked up the entirety of his dinner.



Yay concrete floors.
