_When I'm in my most distractible place I don't chew my thoughts properly. The
most productive times in my life are the ones where I'm just doing my own
thing, focused, and trying to solve some problem that I find interesting--when
I'm narrowly distracted. I've met people who are very into model trains, or
knitting, or coding games for the Commodore 64, and I feel a real kinship
because they find the same pleasure in their activity that I do from writing
and programming.

I'm very paranoid about any metric of productivity. One person's wasted time
is another person's productivity. For most of my life people saw me doing the
things I liked to do and said, "you have too much free time on your hands."
I've decided that when you hear that, it means you're doing something right._
