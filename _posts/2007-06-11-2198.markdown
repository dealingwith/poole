> "Hey! I told you that in confidence."

"You told me that when you were hammered. Remember? That Friday after Melissa
dumped you for that buzz-cut boiler-room dude with the pinkie ring."

"You mean the hedge-fund analyst with the Lexus, the apartment overlooking
Michigan Avenue and the condo on the lake in New Buffalo?"

"Is that how she described him? ... You poor sap."

"I'm happy she's happy."

"Stop it."

"She followed her bliss..."

"I'll have to kill you."

"Found her soulmate."

"Seriously."
