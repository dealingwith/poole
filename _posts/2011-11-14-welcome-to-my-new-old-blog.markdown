Hi. I'm Daniel. I've run a blog of some sort or another since 2001. I was originally on Blogger, then Moveable Type, then a little piece of software I wrote myself called SWIM. Then I ran away from what I considered "normal" blogging and was hiding away on LiveJournal for a while.

Last year I started a blog using Jekyll. 

Now I'm trying to move everything to Jekyll, which means every post will be an old fashioned HTML file here on my very own server. No database. No server side scripts to be hacked.

Eventually this will happen. In the meantime I'm just trying to get one post to show up!
