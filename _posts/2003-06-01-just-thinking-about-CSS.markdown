Hey with all this talk/bullshit about CSS in design these days, why the hell doesn't someone try to standardize tag classes (to some extent)?



That way, we could allow our users to choose from a repository of designs, or at least we could re-use CSS from that repository ourselves, without changing our markup at all.



Surely someone has thought about this before? Is that sort-of what <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/">CSS Zen Garden</a> is supposed to be?
