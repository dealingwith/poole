I have many thoughts about: art, technology, psychology. The usual. But no
time to actual write them down.

The funny thing about programming is that it (almost always, in my experience)
[works better with someone there & both of you talking most of the time][1],
and/or [it works better with no one there or talking any of the time][2].This
of course applies to more domains than just programming. At present, I have
neither scenario actualized in any working domain. This can lead to
[frustration][3].
