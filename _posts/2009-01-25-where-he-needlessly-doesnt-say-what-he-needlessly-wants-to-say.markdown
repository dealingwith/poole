There's this person. This person came very, very, frighteningly close, about
18 months ago, to pushing me over an emotional cliff, the bottom of which was
death. The Looney Tunes tree sticking out of the cliff wall that I grabbed
hold of, I still don't even know what that was. It was a group of people that
have known me longer than any of you ever will.


There are some people that have not known me that long, but have known me
longer than they have known her. And these people I am going to have to say
goodbye to.


I wish I knew more. All I know is that I'm baffled. And betrayed. And I'll see
you around, maybe once a year. Maybe less. And I'll resist the urge to beat
some sense into you.
