Yes, yes, I know I've blogged this link twice already in the past, but it is so worth it! This site is the first I ever found doing daily serials--in fact, I got the term from them! Very, very cool site, hard to grasp at times; but try "treadsoftly"--the entire text is on the homepage right now. Good stuff.
