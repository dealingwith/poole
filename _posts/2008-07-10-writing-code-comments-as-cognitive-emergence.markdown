{ I'm not sure if this actually qualifies as Cognitive Emergence--in fact it
might be the opposite of--and I'm not sure if it might apply to other/all
forms of writing. Feel free to steer me right. }

I had my daily reminder of how smart I'm not while writing some code comments.
I started to write something like, "A requirement of..." and then thought,
"Wait, is it?" Turns out, it wasn't. I was putting a (rather large) extra step
in my code, which was adding complexity that might have been (I'll confirm
soon) the source of many headaches yesterday.

{ And that extra step is still in the app/code I posted the other day. Not
sure many readers know Flex, but a gold star if you find it. }

{ Update: I quickly realized the step was still necessary* for my actual demo.
The app I posted the other day still does not require it, however. }

{ * Update: Sort of. Not really. Good honk. Are we having fun yet? }
