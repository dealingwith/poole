I've never talked about Mellencamp before, I actually don't have a single record of his, and maybe it's at the risk of sounding campy (heh), but he is one of my fav musicians. His next record is supposed to be more 'folk' ...if the new song released on mp3 is any indication, it is going to be a great album.
