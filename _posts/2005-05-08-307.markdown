[Here I am on a particularly nasty bender with my brother Dennis and my other
cousin Lindsay down the shore.][1] Later that night, Lindsay beat up a cop
because she thought he stole her lipstick and Dennis disappeared for eight
weeks. When he came back, he spoke Russian. It was a really strange time.

Many would say that my parents were irresponsible for letting us drink at such
a young age, but I disagree. They were just cooler than your parents, you
jealous bitch.
