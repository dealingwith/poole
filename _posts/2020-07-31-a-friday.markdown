### I emerge from my "office"

...which is a desk in the corner of the bedroom. I observe that my family is back from their [kayaking trip](https://www.instagram.com/p/CDUJZJCnoym/), had picked up Chic-fil-a for lunch, and have consumed it. It's about one o'clock. I had just finished the Cliff Bar I had grabbed for breakfast at 8am. 

Lucy asks, "Want to play a game?"

I reply, "Sure."

We play a game of [Sleeping Queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Queens).

She asks to play another game. I say I have to go back to work. I say I have to shower!

"Smell your pits!" she demands. I make to put my armpit in her face. "No! *You* smell *your own* pits!" I do not acquiesce. With my pit near her face, she declares, "You don't smell that bad, you don't have to shower." I laugh and say ok. "This time, though: [Uno Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_Attack)."

"I only like to play Uno Attack with three or more people," I say.

Mommy doesn't want to play.

"Mr. Elephant will play!" Lucy is a problem solver.

### After dark, I sit at my computer

My music streaming service of choice suggests I listen to _MAKTUB_. Good idea, I think. It's the wrong _Maktub_. It's a Korean pop act of some sort. I search for and find the correct [Maktub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maktub). I think of Daniel Spils, who I was fortunate enough to correspond with, then meet in person (along with the rest of the band) when the band came through town, in 2005. It was a memorable occasion. It was a bright spot in a brief but dark period of my life. I did not know even darker times were to come.

I discover Daniel has been making music with his wife. They call themselves [The Argument](http://www.theargument.us/). Their debut record [is quite good](http://www.theargument.us/album-1).

They're currently doing [1-minute covers. They're delightful](http://www.theargument.us/covid-covers).

It's so nice when good people make art because art needs to be made, and they do it simply but with excellence in their modest Seattle home.
