[Weezer, plane crashes and everything else that’s worrying about the real-time
web][1] by Paul Carr

> ...what were we all doing? Filming and tweeting and checking in rather than
just putting our phones away and enjoying the gig. Why does the world need two
thousand photos of the same band on the same stage, all taken from a slightly
different angle. That kind of 360 degree imagery might have been useful on the
day Kennedy was shot – not least because it would have kept Oliver Stone quiet
– but for a Weezer gig?


...And yet this real-time mentality – pictures/tweets or it didn’t happen –
continues to seep into every aspect of our lives, both personally and
professionally. Whereas once we might attend a conference to watch the
speakers and perhaps learn something, today our priority is to live blog it –
to ensure our followers know we’re on the inside...

[Real-Time is a Collaboration][2] by Kevin Makice

> The second key assumption is that the real-time web is an individual
activity. It isn’t. Individuals are involved, but the appeal and value of
real-time content is in the sheer number of people participating and the wide
range of personal experiences they capture.


...With new information comes new skills and opportunity for reflection. We
see this happening all the time with the evolving strategies of Twitter
use...The value you see today may not be the same value you will see tomorrow.
People change.


It would be a mistake to adopt a utopian view and discount Carr’s critique.
However, I believe that what will ultimately emerge from real-time web is a
Zen awareness in the here and now. The current flaws in this beast can and
will be overcome.

And from the comments to the original TechCrunch article:

> Too long, please translate into 140 characters. [#][3]

> It's a Shrodinger's tweet phenomemon. [#][4]

I have a two part response to all this, and hopefully it won't take me weeks
to compose it, but it will take longer than right now, so for now, I leave
these without comment. These will become links to the follow up posts,
however:
