I wanna swear it’s true but it’s hard to defend it / I know it comes from You
and I don’t comprehend it / Love never fails / Mercy will prevail / I wanna
swear it’s true but it’s hard to defend it / In the chill of a cruel word / In
the nest of a wounded bird / In the shadow of doubt / In the smoke / In the
smoke of a torch blown out / I wanna swear it’s true but it’s hard to believe
it / I know it comes from You so I want to receive it / Divine love never
fails / Mercy will prevail / I wanna swear it’s true but it’s hard to believe
it / In the thrust of a bayonet / In the hour of deep regret / In a world gone
insane / In the eye / In the eye of a hurricane / In the chill of a cruel word
/ In the nest of a wounded bird / In the shadow of doubt / In the smoke / In
the smoke of a torch blown out / In the flight of a sharp stone



I just might need to take a break
