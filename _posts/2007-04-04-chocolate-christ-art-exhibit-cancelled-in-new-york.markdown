> Who didn’t see this coming?: "Chocolate Christ art exhibit cancelled in New
York." Catholic America had its way with the Lab Gallery in midtown Manhattan
on Friday when it got Cosimo Cavallaro’s awesomely-named "My Sweet Lord"
exhibit featuring an anatomically-correct, 200 pound, 6-foot-tall milk
chocolate rendering of the Big Guy cancelled days before its scheduled Monday
evening opening. Set to run throughout Holy Week with the final day of the
exhibit culminating on Easter Sunday, the show drew death threats and outcry
from Catholic Americans and Cardinal Edward Egan about the nature of El
Supremo's depiction, sans-loincloth. Never mind the "Staff of God," what they
should have been pissed off about was JC's George Carlin-style douchebag
ponytail.

...from the comments gave me a great idea for an easter installation...but i'm
