[A small moment from The Big Kahuna:

Phil: The question is, do you have any character at all? And if you want my
honest opinion, Bob, you do not. For the simple reason that you don't regret
anything yet.

Bob: Are you saying I won't have any character unless I do something I regret?

Phil: No, Bob. I'm saying you've already done plenty of things to regret. You
just don't know what they are. It's when you discover them. When you see the
folly in something you've done. And you wish you had to do over. But you know
you can't because it's too late. So you pick that thing up and you carry it
with you. To remind you that life goes on. The world will spin without you.
You really don't matter in the end. Then will you attain character. Because
honesty will reach out from inside and tattoo itself all across your face.

Words to live by.][1]
