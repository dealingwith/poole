> *Multi-Linear Narratives: Letting the Player Lead the Game*

> Entering a city, a house or any other interactive environment, different
people have unique desires which the ideal environment both receives and
responds to. This is not so with many games, however. In the most interactive
of environments, players are often led, railroad style, down a prescribed path
toward fixed ends. In this talk, award-winning game designer Brenda Brathwaite
explores this problem and offers some solutions through the use of multi-
linear narratives and the role of the un-storied mechanic in creating an
experience players believe they crafted.

From the description for [an upcoming talk][1] being given by legendary game
designer [Brenda Brathwaite][2] in San Francisco. If you are within range of
my voice and San Francisco, you should try and make this talk and report back
to me in detail. (From the comments on the blog it does not seem to be as
gender-specific as it may first appear.)


What you really need to go watch as well is her talk [How I Dumped Electricity
and Learned to Love Design][3].


My interests are returning to game-design, the multi/non-linear nature of
which was the inspiration for this blog (it started as a notebook of links and
ideas about how to create ARG's and other non-linear narratives). I thought it
appropriate that this important figure in game design is speaking about multi-
linear narratives at the same time I return to that area as a place of
intellectual interest.
