[reddit.com: Serious Twitter security concern: Whenever I send a new request
to the server, I'm in a different random account, which I can use (Video)][1]

[Today was Twitter as Someone Else Day, and no one told me][2]

[looks like Twitter ate the brown acid][3]

[oh gee wiz, that was weird, sorry 'bout that, dum-de-dum][4]

and of course, for me at least, twitter over IM remains a fail going on two
weeks now. this makes receiving notifications from edge network people or
tracking anything impossible (simply can't have that many msgs sent to my
phone).

worst ratio of great idea to technical incompetence. sad, really.

in other news: [normative][5] ([normative][6]), omg like u kno i'm totally
going to get bored sometime this afternoon and totally read that whole thing
