[News 14 Carolina gets pwnt][1]:

> On February 26, 2004, we had a snowstorm here in Raleigh, and all the news
channels posted the businesses and schools that would be closed the next day.
One of these fine news organizations, Time Warner Cable's News 14 Carolina,
chose the most convenient but least secure method to allow businesses to
report closings: the Internet. Well, it wasn't long before members of The Wolf
Web, an NCSU message board, exposed this flaw. They went crazy, as you're
about to see. The best part of the whole thing was once a closing was
accepted, it could be edited on the Internet and would go straight to TV
without having to be reviewed again, so a fake closing that seemed plausible
the first time it was shown could be outrageous the next time.
