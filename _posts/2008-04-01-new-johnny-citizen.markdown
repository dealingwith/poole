[Johnny Citizen Header][3]

Originally uploaded by [dealingwith][4]

Updated [Johnny Citizen][5]'s site. The old one just. didn't. work. It was low
priority but yesterday I just couldn't stand it anymore and then once I
started I had to finish. I'm using [Virb][6] as my primary online touch-point
for the band, it has the best design and all the tools necessary ([blog][7],
etc {old Johnny Citizen blog is going to remain a secret so I can post
whateverthefuckIwant to it}). Simple-as-possible-while-still-having-something-
to-see was the goal with the new main site.
