> Enter was an American magazine produced from October 1983 to May 1985 by Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later renamed Sesame Workshop). Similar to sibling titles Sesame Street, The Electric Company, and 3-2-1 Contact magazines, the title was aimed at school-age children. The focus of the magazine was, as declared on the cover, "The world of computers and new technology". Each issue included programs in the BASIC computer language, which readers could type into their own home computer.
