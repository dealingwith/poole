Before we moved to Bosnia I wasn't eating any dairy products or any meat besides fish. I started eating dairy before we even got to Sarajevo, while we were still in Vienna. Over the last two weeks I started eating a little bit of meat; but tonight was the official end of any remains of my pescatarian diet: I had <a href="http://ellensjourney.org/stranger/archives/images/cevapi.html" title="gross, right? but i wish i had kajmak on mine too.">&#269;hevap</a>; I bent to the peer pressure of my Bosnian friends. It was ok; but I think I will be digesting it until next month.
