<blockquote>There'd been this article about Bush & God in Newsweek. It describes this Bible group that Don Evans [Bush's Commerce Secretary and longtime friend] got Bush into when he stopped drinking. [Newsweek writer Howard] Fineman describes it as scriptural boot camp. Ten guys and each week they'd study a chapter of a book over two years and analyze them line by line. Over two years, they read Luke and Acts.



So I was at the White House Correspondents dinner and found myself seated at the table next to Don Evans. I was all set to ask about the tax cut. And I said, "So you know what Acts is about?"



And I saw sort of this blank thing go over his eyes and then sort of a quick look of panic and he said, "No." And I was absolutely shocked. And I said, "Well your tax cut so heavily favors the rich, and <a href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=ACTS+2%3A44-45&x=0&y=0">Acts</a> <a href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=acts+4%3A32-37&x=0&y=0">is so</a> <a href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=acts+5%3A1-11&x=0&y=0">socialist</a> almost."



And he said, "But, ah! Acts contains the Parable of the Talents." Now just as it so happens, I knew that actually wasn't true. I knew <a href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&version=NIV&passage=matt+25%3A14-30&x=0&y=0">the parable of talents was from Matthew</a>. And he said, "Are you sure?" And I said, "Yeah."



...But I realized that these guys didn't read these books line by line for two years and discuss them for two years--they couldn't have! I know these guys aren't the smartest guys in the world but they're not that dumb...



I just have to believe that what he told Fineman was a lie. That was the only conclusion I could come to. Then I talked to Fineman and he remembered talking to Bush during the primaries in New Hampshire. Howard asked him what selection of the Bible he'd read that day because the campaign was saying that Governor Bush read the Bible every day.



And we tracked down the transcript and Bush was totally defensive and it seemed to me from the transcript that he really didn't read the Bible every day. He just said he did--which is, like, a very weird thing to lie about.</blockquote>via <a href="http://www.powazek.com/2004/07/000420.html">powazek</a>
