I've been conspicuously consuming music in the last week, most of it of the
quality i would like to share with you, so that you might also consume and
enjoy, and support great arteests!

I've caught [The Chemistry Set][1] live a few times now, but just recently
obtained their records. And they are good. From the latest, _blue monsters_:

[Love (dance on the one that brought you)][2] [T-rex devours the
glitteratti][3]

Both of their records available from their web site. Their first record is
also really quite amazing.

Last Wednesday I "led" the book study for my church group thing, and made a
mix CD as a party favor. The topic was time.

[time][4] (29.7M ZIP, 8 songs)

Those were only the top 8 from what turned out to be a _ton_ of songs about
time on my hard drive.

[time extras][5] (68.5M ZIP, 16 songs)

...and even that was being further selective...

...more tomorrow
