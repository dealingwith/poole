> The truth of art lies in its power to break the monopoly of established
reality (i.e., of those who established it) to define what is real."

--Herbert Marcuse, [The Aesthetic Dimension][6]

The expression "altered states" makes many people think of the effect of
controlled substances on the brain. . .But the drug experience is just a neat
metaphor for what we all know and understand twenty-first century life to be:
a single continuous altered state. In this day and age, you don't have to be a
fancy philosopher to realize that reality is endlessly mediated, managed and
manuactured. . .how then do we proceed?

. . .One solution is to remember that actual living humans still lurk behind
the facades and empty forms of modern existence. Who are they? What do they
think about? What do they care about?_

i had this thought today: I love it when my (number of) build errors are
exponents of the build errors I've fixed.
