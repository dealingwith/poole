At first blush, [Traction Software][1] looks like a cheesy "blog" "enterprise"
play -- i.e. repackage blogs to make them more palatable for [Office Space][2]
managers.


Fortunately, I had, by happy accident, a chance to be demo'd Traction not once
but twice. I say fortunately because I had already seen the Traction site and
made the snap judgment mentioned above, and because it took both those demos
for all the lightbulbs to go off (about half each time).


Without that experience, it will hard to understand how on-target they are,
since they are all enterprisey -- which means little access for individuals.
But they do have a [blog][3] of some intelligence.


And during the second demo the sales guy went on a tiny tangent about the
philosophy behind Traction, mentioning [Vannevar Bush][4] and referencing [As
We May Think][5] and [Memex][6] as source material.


Can't summarize those links. Have to follow them if you want to follow this
thread.


I like when people think before they build. I wish Traction success. They very
well may be the closest I've seen to getting the Semantic Web, or maybe just
what Hypertext has wanted to be all along. I wish they had a more consumer-
accessible version or offering so they could get a bit more of a memic
foothold in the [user-generated content][7] space.


Heheh...I said "space." Ding a bell.
