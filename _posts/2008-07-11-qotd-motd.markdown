[Said the Gramophone: Priority on Your Attention][1]:

> I might have Reverse Seasonal Affective Disorder. Or I might not get along
with heat waves.

Everything romantic happens in the Fall. Nothing romantic, and I mean
romantic, happens any other time.

My car won't start. That is because God is fed the fuck up.

Self-righteousness is the breakfast food I am addicted to. Every morning,
without fail, even sometimes at night.

This is very close to my mood, save for the car, but no doubt God is fed up,
so I'm about to listen to the tune recommended there. Can't vouch for it yet,
but [the whole record is available for download][2], so what the heck.
