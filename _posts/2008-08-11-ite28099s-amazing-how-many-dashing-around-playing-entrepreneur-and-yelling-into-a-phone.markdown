[Ideas, Execution, and the Rare Auteur][1]:

> It’s amazing how many sociopaths are out there dashing around, playing
entrepreneur, and yelling into a phone about drilling-down — with what appears
to be no idea how to actually get something amazing to market.

They sing themselves little songs and tell themselves little stories over
ciabatta sandwiches and Excel, rhapsodizing about their personal Candyland
where everybody starts using their goofy product because… just…because. It’s
crazy. And it’s everywhere.

...An idea is no more useful than a coupon for a bag of sugar; show me the
finished cake, then we’ll talk.

The bottom line is that if you don’t have an amazing, passionate idea and the
means to make it superb, you’re probably just a douchebag with an expensive
phone. And a stack of NDAs.
