I've been struggling since about the beginning of the year with my data format for SWM. I was set on XML, but there are some basic problems with it. There are also basic problems with databases, especially on webservers (hence my original decision to go with XML). I'm still working this out, but <a href="http://www.dynamicobjects.com/~diego/weblogs/arf/archives/2003_02_02.html#000811">this post at dynamicobjects.com</a>, the spaces guy, is very helpful in hashing out these issues.
