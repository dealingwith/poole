Tim Bray, [Blogging in 2017](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2017/05/03/Blogging-in-2017):

> I won­der what the Web will be like when we’re a cou­ple more gen­er­a­tions in? I’m pret­ty sure that as long as it re­mains easy to fill a lit­tle bit of the great names­pace with your words and pic­tures, peo­ple will.

> The great dan­ger is that the Web’s fu­ture is mall-like: No space re­al­ly pub­lic, no store­fronts but na­tion­al brands’, no vi­su­als com­posed by am­a­teurs, noth­ing that’s on of­fer just for its own sake, and for love.

> This is the true value I find in reading indie blogs. They are made by people with a real history and real values. They have a voice and a personality that's hard to match with an editorial staff and a team of interns. If you stick with them you're going to develop a relationship to the writing that pays dividends.

Keeping a personal blog in 2017 feels relatively futile. But while everyone else is <s>storing</s> throwing their stories, artifacts, thoughts and meanings into the stream for others to consume on their phones while taking a dump or bored at lunch or while cosuming some other media entirely, those of us who store our work on _actual domains_ do it for ourselves--and our legacy. And while permalinks may--and do--rot faster than last week's bananas, the content is still _here_.
