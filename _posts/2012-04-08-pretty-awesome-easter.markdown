...managed to crawl out of bed in time to make the morning ride and I never regret it when I do. I pieced together a few different routes and we ended up with a really pleasant [54 miles](http://app.strava.com/rides/6404927). The temperature was pretty perfect (about 70F), the legs felt good, clouds protected us from the Texas sun (now they're watering our [still] parched land, which makes me even happier to have gotten a ride in early) and there were no flats or any other types of trouble.

When I got home Lucy was all smiles and chatty, too. She's becoming more delightful by the day. I sat on the kitchen floor and soaked it in while I ate and drank.

Then I watched Tom Boonen dominate Paris-Roubaix on the DVR.

Now I have to work. Hopefully that doesn't ruin everything.
