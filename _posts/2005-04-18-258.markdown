[The other day I bought lunch at McDonald's. My receipt was attached to the
bag with a small sticker proudly proclaiming their latest slogan: "i'm lovin'
it."

As I gnawed on a so-so fry, I wondered exactly who was lovin' what. Apparently
I was lovin' McDonald's, I guess. I don't remember being consulted, but there
it was in sticker-form. It was even trademarked, so I guess my lovin' must be
heartfelt and true.

Granted, McDonald's and I have a history, but isn't this all a little
presumptuous? And do they really need to be dragging the L word into it? They
didn't even have the courtesy to say they were lovin' me back! (I won't lie.
It stings.)

I thought I'd help Ronald out and whip up my own set of McStickers that cover
a slightly larger emotional spectrum...][1]
