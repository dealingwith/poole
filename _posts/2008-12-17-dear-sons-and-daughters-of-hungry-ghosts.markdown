[Peter Rollins: Ghosts are real...][1]

> Those we love will always be remembered, but when we have unfinished
business with them, when we feel that they died to us before their time, they
will continue to haunt us. While the light of their life is extinguished, a
faint but persistent aroma of their presence remains.

While those we cherish were absent to us before we ever met them, the absence
that is formed in their aftermath is of a fundamentally different quality. For
this posthumously generated absence has weight and substance. It is, as Sartre
would say, a felt absence.

...this ghostly presence of an absence is what haunts us until we make our
peace with it and let it go.

To do this we must learn how to mourn, for mourning marks the passing of the
dead and allows us to make peace with our ghosts.

Funny he should write this soon after [I wrote this][2].
