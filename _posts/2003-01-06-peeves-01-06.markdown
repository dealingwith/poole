...first in a series not to exceed 99...



...in no particular order...



01. Hold music. It all sucks. It all sucks REALLY BAD playing out of my CRAPPY SPEAKERPHONE! A little reminder that we're still on every few seconds is all we need, people!



02. Flash, in any form besides behind a link along the lines of "Flash animation/cartoon thingie if you click here." Flash sucks DIRT for *normal* web sites, navigation, and PARTICULARLY for ANNOYING ADVERTS.



03. Popups. Put an add across the top of your page, along either side, at the bottom, in the middle, fine, do that, that's just fine. BUT DO NOT OPEN ANOTHER WINDOW DAMMIT!



04. Opening a new window from a link. Give me the option to do this, fine. But don't do it automatically. <b>What, are you insecure or something? Afraid I won't come back to your precious website?</b> Awww, you poor baby, I'm clicking away from your site, better keep your site up in an annoying extra window somewhere...



05. Music on websites. I AM ALREADY LISTENING TO MUSIC, ASSMUNCH. Your contribution to my auditory space creates a nasty cacophony. I cannot hear your crap, and you've pissed me off.



06. All "customer service" (<a href="http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/me/20030106.me.06.ram">NPR bit from this morning in RAM format</a>)
