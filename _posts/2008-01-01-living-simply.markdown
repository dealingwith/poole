[![][1]][1]Here's 2008 and it's time to go over the goals and set some stuff
to do this year. And what better place than 43 Things?

First off, things I think I've done. First up, live simply. I think I've done
a pretty good job of this most of my life. Every time I've moved in the last 7
years I've simplified more.

{Just out of personal curiosity:

Florida (house) - Florida (apartment) 2001

Florida - DC 2002

DC - Bosnia 2003

Bosnia - Florida 2003

Florida - Dallas 2004

Dallas - Dallas 2004, 2005

Dallas - PA 2007

PA - Dallas 2007

And I'm planning on moving when my lease is up hereâ€¦}

Since my last move I've done without any appliances in the kitchen except a
coffee maker. No desk, just one table. No stereo, it's in the closet and can
probably go next move (although the amp and speakers might fill out a media
center in the future). No TV. Major CD and book expunge.

I did get a new bike a couple months ago. But I like it a lot. And it's
simple. :)
