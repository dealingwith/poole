Believe it or not, doing research for the project I'm writing a proposal for
involves watching a lot of YouTube, hence the double post of YouTube comedy.
The last director was actually relevant to my research; this one was a random
link but made me laugh harder than I have in a very long time. I love Whose
Line Is It Anyway, but had never seen this obviously classic moment.
