			First a little backstory: So I just walked home from the Dremo's open mic, where I played second-to-last to a handful of die-hards who came out and stayed out despite the snow. And I just walked home in the sub-sub temperatures and have arrived positively reeking of smoke to my cozy apartment four-or-so blocks away. I played my new version of Cohen's Hallelujah--yes, the 1M'th cover version of that song, but at least <i>this version</i> is mine--and it went over quite well.



So the first cat to play was actually a duo with a drum machine. I won't tell you much more, but the dude had reading glasses--he was a very cool, older cat...

Jimmy was the grandson of Carolina sharecroppers and a vietnam vet who brought his asian bride Nikki back with him after his fourth tour. He was an old R&B cat. Nikki learned bass and they played the Red Lion Tavern North in Charleston and raised two sons before moving to Virginia. He had a voice like a Hershey's bar and played everything from Marvin Gaye to Shania Twain for his dedicated audiences of drunks and escaped husbands and mothers.



...



Daniel talked to himself. This was a problem. He'd get looks--expecially when he yelled out "Fucking Nazis" in what could only be described as mild torret's syndrome...but then the cell phone--or "mobile" (long "i") as they are known in the "old country"--was invented. Suddenly every sharp dressed man and woman was also talking to his/herself, and Daniel fit right in. Except for the "Fucking Nazis" part.
