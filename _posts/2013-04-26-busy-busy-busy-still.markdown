## Shipping again

Shipped a major refactor/rewrite of our application this week, with a lot of help and a lot of long days. There are still some rough spots but this was a huge win for sanity and future velocity. I also accepted a full time offer this week (or was it the end of last week?), so that's official. Will be updating all the pertinent socnets as I get around to it.

## A world all my own

I haven't any time to ride during the week for the last two weeks save for a few bike commutes, but really late at night after I can't code anymore I'll play [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/) for an hour give or take and slowly accomplish objectives in the game.

My valley of relative safety. Over the last few days I've been nurturing a sugarcane farm, from which I made paper (yeah, I don't know either). Tonight I braved the depths of an empty mine I discovered and found some red stone (think magic uranium), I made it back to the surface, crafted a compass and then, combined with my paper, a map. I must say, I felt a great sense of accomplishment.
