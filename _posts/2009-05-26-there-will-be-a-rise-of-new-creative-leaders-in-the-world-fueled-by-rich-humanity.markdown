[John Maeda: Creative Leaders Get Their Hands Dirty][1]

> In the last few decades, technology has encouraged our fascination with
perfection--whether it's six sigma manufacturing, the zero-contaminant clean
room, or in its simplest form, _"2.0."_ Given the new uncertainty in the world
however, I can see that it is time to question this approach--of over-technologized, over-leveraged, over-advanced living. The next big thing? Dirty
hands...

(_em_ mine) (via [his twitters][2])

I've noticed this a lot. All you must do is notice the rash of new bike
builders that have popped up around the country...the whole maker
thing...DIY...gardening...We have definitely moved through _authenticity_ and
on to _simplicity_, and if that is how things are trending, I can't wait to
see what the next thing is.

Speaking of bike building, besides [fastboy's flickr stream][3], this video is
one of the most aesthetically pleasing documents of the process:
