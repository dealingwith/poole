> If you've been to scissorkick in the past, you probably know that Norway's Jaga Jazzist is one of our absolute favorite bands currently churning out the unclassifiable tunes. So it is with great pleasure that today's post is a track from their upcoming record What We Must to be released on Ninja Tune later this season. What will surely be regarded as a perfectly timed Spring release, the new album features seven epic tracks crossing countless genres but what will stick out most noticeably to fans is the heavy presence of guitars. Some stretches sound as if Tortoise and My Bloody Valentine copulated and birthed a new form of hyphenated monster like post-prog- shoegazer-rock or fusion-jazz-ambient-rock.
