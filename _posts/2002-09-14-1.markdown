Tonight: <a href="http://fray.org/6/dc/">{ fray day 6 } Washington DC</a>

<b>Update:</b> Well, it was incredible. They video'd the whole thing so if yer curious I bet u won't have to wait long. Miriam and I went with a really amazing friend of ours, Ryan. Both Ryan and I participated in the open mic, so that (I guess) will be on the site as well. I cursed a lot during my story--too much for my own taste if u can believe it! But besides that, we were really, really amazed at the quality of all the stories and the storytelling. The open mic was really incredible. It was a great night, indeed personifying my mission (s :: s :: b :: m).
