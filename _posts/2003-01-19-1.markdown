Yesterday was a wash between the protest and practicing for a duo I'm playing drums for next weekend (more on both later). 



Today I'm getting very, very, very frustrated with our second laptop, which has never worked, just spent 2 weeks in the shop and supposedly got a new hard drive; I say supposedly because it is having the exact same problem as before. I've spent probably a total of 8 hours since I got it back from the shop trying to get a stable system installed on it, and now it is hanging the same way as it was before. 2 weeks and all I get for my trouble is 8 less hours of my life and a cracked case! So the machine is fucked. I'm unsure whether to follow up with the service center that just worked on it or just send it back to my brother-in-law, who I bought it off of, and say either "send me back a stable machine" or just "forget it, can I have me money back." Then shell out more than twice as much for a new one...or just work out some arrangement with M over this one. Oh, for the conflict-over-computer-free two weeks we had when we first got this second machine and it actually worked...
