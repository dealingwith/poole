Escalator Maintenance Society just left from setting up and rehersing, and I didn't know what to expect either, but it's really good fun. Think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00005O6PA/qid=1120951763/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_ur_2/102-5131049-5514530?v=glance&s=music&n=507846">Amelie</a>. Come over! The AC is cranking, the red is ready to pour, and the Tecate is chillin. If you don't like those options bring your own. Or I'll make you a cup of proper tea or coffee if you like.

Update:

What a show! *gush* ...tonight was a good night, a lot of fun with some amazing people. I love and thank you all. */gush*
