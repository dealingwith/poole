I'm realizing much of the problems with software is that it aims to make
complex processes more simple (by which I mean simple-minded), instead of
either making complex processes _ridiculously_ simple or making complex
processes _easier_.

Case in point is my current conundrum, content management. Content management
-slash- website design and maintenance are very complex tasks. Most tools try
to wash those tasks so an average user can accomplish some of them, and the
tool takes care of the rest.

IMHO:

Instead, a CMS should be either just a white box, _or_ all the abstract pieces
for a developer to contruct the white boxes.

...if that made any sense at all

Bottom line, the existing paradigms for tool creation only frustrate everyone,
instead of solving problems on the heavily populated edges and forcing those
few in the middle to choice naivety or mastery.

...later: realized this is similar to the beginning of [this][1], or at best a
continuation...
