"What caused the use of force to occur? Civil disobedience. If there was no civil disobedience, there would have been no injury and there would have been no use of force. If we don't have that civil disobedience, you don't have the use of force by police." Lt. Jeffrey Herold, Metropolitan Police Dept.
