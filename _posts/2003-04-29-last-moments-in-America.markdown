Sitting in the airport right now, we have less than 1 hour left as residents of the USA. {Of course, according to the IRS, we are still US residents.} We appropriately spent some of our last day here in the mall, getting one last overdose of consumerism and Americans. Normally a horrible experience, made better in the knowledge that it was my last chance to experience the odd traits that are this country.
