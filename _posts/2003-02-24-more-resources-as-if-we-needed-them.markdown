via <a href="http://www.theyblinked.com/blog/">theyblinked</a>, I find <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0890967709/qid=1046107911/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/103-8557930-2747830?v=glance&s=books">The Conceit of Innocence</a> by Stjepan G. Mestrovic (among others, Dan was <a href="http://www.theyblinked.com/blog/2003_02_23_theyblinked_archive.html#89614649">referencing</a> someone else), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author=Mestrovic%2C%20Stjepan%20G./103-8557930-2747830">turns out he has a few more books on Bosnia, etc</a>.

Interesting are the two reviews:<blockquote>Excellently exposes the pretence of post-Cold War morality, November 18, 1999
Reviewer: A reader from Washington
The book is an excellent examination of the philosophical and psycho-social issues that the West now has to grapple with due to its (im)moral mishandling of the Bosnian crisis. Far from being a diatribe which serves the propaganda interests of any side, the authors explore the multiple implications that have arisen due to the loss of Western morality (or perhaps, the sham that was the West's previous pretence to morality) from various angles, and discuss not only what this means for the Bosnian themselves, but also its importance for today's Western societies.</blockquote>VS...<blockquote>Croatian Propaganda, October 9, 1998
Reviewer: nt@sentex.net from Toronto
Mr. Mestrovic, an ethnic croat, writes a bogus, completely biased account ofthe civil war in Bosnia. He gets plenty of assistence to bash Serbs from a Muslim co-author. He rehashs the tired Zagreb-Sarajevo party line of a "land grab" by the serbs and completely ignores the fact that Serbs made up a full 33% of Bosnia before the war. He of course, completely ignores war crimes commnitted by Croats and Muslims against Serb civilians. Also, Mestrovic ignores the role of Croatia in fomenting war amongst the croats and Muslims. A good read for any student of propaganda. A poor work if one is searching for facts.</blockquote>Hmmm... Shed any light on the situation over there? Possibly more than the book itself...
