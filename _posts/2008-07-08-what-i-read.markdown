I exported my Google Reader subscriptions to create some straight-forward XML
to build the beginnings of a demo Flex app with, so I thought I would share:
[Google Reader Subscriptions OPML][1]. ("[OPML][2]?" you ask?)

[And here is the app][3], if you are interested. It loads that very OPML file
in order to create the list to the left, then just loads the site's URL into a
new tab on the right. If you right-click w/in the Flash bits (that is anywhere
outside of the iframe beneath the tab bar), you can view source. It took about
6 days, from first downloading [Flex Builder][4], through much head-on-desk
pain, to what you see. The good news is, I think I have the heavy lifting
done. Now (after maybe another day's tweaking) to re-create the same demo in
[GWT][5].
