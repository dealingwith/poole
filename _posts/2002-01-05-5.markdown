somedays you just wonder why you bothered getting up in the morning. other days you can't hardly bear to go back to bed and can't wait for the next morning to get started again.

somedays you want to grab the world by the balls and maul it's head off. other days you run crying into the corner as soon as you hear the world's voice.
