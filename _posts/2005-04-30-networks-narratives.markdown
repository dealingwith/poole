> Models and theories from disciplines like complex adaptive systems should be
deployed in this regard, Davis and Alleyne recommended. Organisations like
IBM's Cynefin Centre have developed classifications of knowledge work into
categories like known, knowable, complex and chaotic, focusing not just on
storytelling but on narrative analysis for collaborative sense-making and
decision-making inputs. Tools like participatory observation, anecdote
circles, deep immersion, organisational metaphors and naive interviews are
useful in this regard.


Storytelling is used to promote knowledge sharing at NASA, via Transfer Wisdom
Workshops and Project Management Shared Experiences Program conducted by the
Academy of Program and Project Leadership (APPL).


In terms of narrative structuring, tools like 'knowledge blogging' (or k-logs,
a term coined by John Robb, president of Userland) have a lot of potential.
Stories are a good framework for sharing information, meaning and knowledge.
Blogs encourage story-telling and foster understanding because they usually
offer context,' according to Darlene Fichter, library coordinator at the
University of Saskatchewan Library.


'Knowledge blogs help encourage brain dumps, exploration, and think-aloud
behaviour. They create connected content, break down silos, allow comments,
and can also be treasured as useful searchable archives,' she observed.


Besides, over time, blogs are self-rewarding. 'Often bloggers report that they
discover their own interests and refine their perspectives. It leads to peer
recognition,' according to Fichter.


Klogs are also a useful, low-cost and flexible tool for competitive
intelligence (CI), said Arik Johnson, managing director of Aurora WDC. Well-
designed CI blogs can help collect, analyse, package, and deliver current
awareness and early warning of competitive and regulatory developments for
sales staff and top managers.


Blogs help write thought pieces to guide the organisation on a strategic path.
Bloggers can collect and connect information and provide useful overlays of
context. 'Blogging has enough critical mass and momentum, and will soon be
integrated with other KM tools,' predicted Johnson.


Monitoring, metrics and measurement are important requisites to understanding
the effect of KM networks and narrative databases, but companies often confuse
technology, process, knowledge, employee and business metrics.
