...because it is so freaking cool. And it hits me on many levels: I've always
hated most presentations, let alone PowerPoint, that atrocity.

ideas.


The ideology of ZuiPrezi is based our natural knowledge on how to coordinate
ourselves in space; traditionally all information we have had to process and
store used to be linked to physical space. That is where our minds have
developed good skills in orienting ourselves. Despite all this digital
information today is mostly presented to us as a moniker of printed matter. Of
course printing has served us well to store (and shape) information for the
the last six centuries, however, with the wide appearance of computing we saw
the same old pattern: old forms got translated to new media without exploring
its full potential. Most of the computer systems which present us with
information today use the old paradigm of prints and slides: arranging
information on a framed 2d static space. We could argue that these (at least
their forms) are merely the side effect of Gutenberg's galaxy.

[This sample presentation give a high-level overview of what it is about][4].


[Here you can find another video and many sample preso's, including a walk
through where you can play with the wonderfully intuitive creation
interface][5].


This came out of [Kitchen Budapest][6], a technology incubator very much like
what I had dreamed [Integration Research][7] would become. Check out [a
ZuiPrezi presentation about Kitchen Budapest][8], and/or [read more about them
on their website][9] (and be sure to check out their awesome "press" icon).
