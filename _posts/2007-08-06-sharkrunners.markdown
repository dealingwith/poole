> In the game, players control their ships, but the sharks are controlled by
real-world white sharks with GPS units attached to their fins. Real-world
telemetry data provides the position and movement of actual great white sharks
in the game, so every shark that players encounter corresponds to a real shark
in the real world.


Ships in the game move in real-time, so players receive email and/or SMS
alerts during the day when their boat is within range of an encounter.
