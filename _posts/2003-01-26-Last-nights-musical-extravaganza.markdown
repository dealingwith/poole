Last night's gig with the Hsu Sisters, aka <a href="http://exitclov.com">Exit Clov</a>, was a rousing success. The sound was good, the crowd was good (thank you to the 8 who came just to see me play drums and on my recommendation of the music!), and my mostly borrowed minimalist drum kit was in full effect! Be sure to check out their song, <a href="http://exitclov.com/audiophile/audiophile.htm">Renegade</a>, definately one of my favorite songs of 2002 (I was priveledged to get their demo last fall and have been wanting to share that tune ever since!).

Immediately after our set, a friend of mine convinced me to go to the Camper Van Beethoven show at the famous 9:30 club in DC. Camper Van is a band I was introduced to in high school, but hadn't kept up with. I knew this was going to be my only chance ever to catch them live, and then at the 9:30 club. It was totally worth it.



Walking back to the car at 1:00 or so, I semi-joked about how hungry I was after seeing a open restaurant. Well, we spun right around and marched into that establishment, a very authentic Ethiopian place, practically chanting "spongy bread." There was this duo, a keyboardist with a drum sampler and a singer, playing (I assume) Ethiopian music (very similar to Indian kino music). There was a small group of people, not speaking any english, hanging out and dancing. We got a vegetarian platter and enjoyed eating with our hands while soaking in the local culture and being two out of only three white people in the place (there was one woman, very eastern european looking, who was apparently on a date with one of the african guys).



Quite the musical night all and all.
