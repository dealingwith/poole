We arrived safely, met by a few embassy people, which was nice. <a href="miriam/">Miriam</a> has more details.



I am overwhelmed by beauty and speachless for the experience. We actually <em>live</em> here. It is still somewhat unbelievable. After getting a little bit settled, we walked to the pedestrian area (only a couple blocks away) and strolled down to Ba&scaron;car&scaron;ija, the old town. 



I meant to take more pictures and have more words, but I didn't and I don't. <a href="images/sarajevo/may_2003/panarama1_web.jpg">Here is a picture from out of our living room window</a>. {Admittedly, you can only see this view when you are up at the window, from any distance back all you see is the tin roof in front.}
