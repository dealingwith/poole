Have I blogged this link before? I've had Ben Brown's publishing company in my fav's for a while; I'm thinking this is the kind of outfit I want to court with Integration Theory. After Serial Text that is. After After Dinner that is. Don't know what either of those are? You haven't checked out the links on my <a href="writings.html">writings</a> page.
