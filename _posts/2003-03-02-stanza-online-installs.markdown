<a href="http://www.thecentralcity.co.uk/">thecentralcity.co.uk</a> is a v cul online art exhibit integrating visuals, text, electronic music, and shockwave interactions. Its breadth is quite...quite. Can't really get through everything in one sitting, or at least I couldn't. Also check out <a href="http://www.stanza.co.uk/">the artist's site</a> as well for more of everything. Very cul even with the cul-for-about-10-seconds bg music.
