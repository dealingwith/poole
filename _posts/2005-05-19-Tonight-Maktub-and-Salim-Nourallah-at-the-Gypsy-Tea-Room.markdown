In a welcome relief from real life, there is a great show tonight at the <a href="http://gypsytearoom.com">Gypsy Tea Room</a>. Three great reasons to attend:



1. <a href="http://salimnourallah.com/">Salim Nourallah</a> is an amazing musician and local legend.



2. <a href="http://maktub.com/">Maktub</a>, from Seattle, includes <a href="http://www.danielspils.com/">Daniel Spils</a>, part of the <a href="http://robotcoop.com/">Robot Co-op</a>, makers of <a href="http://43things.com">43 Things</a>, and <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/progress/daniel/131017">one of his goals is to meet 43 Things users while on tour</a>.



3. It's <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ryanjewell">Ryan</a>'s birthday / going away party. Ryan runs a lot of the show at both <a href="http://landmarktheaters.com/Market/Dallas/Dallas_Frameset.htm">Landmark Theaters</a> here in Dallas and from what I understand he's moving to Chicago to open a new Landmark there.



<strong>Update:</strong> So it turns out <a href="http://www.maktub.com">Maktub</a> is really good. See this band whenever you have the chance. Bad turnout tonight in Dallas but they still rocked for at least an hour and a half...great tunes, great mix, great stage presence...they have it all. I also was able to talk to Daniel Spils before and after the show...until the GTR people kicked everyone out at 12:45...WTF?
