Not much else needs to be said (<a href="http://www.capt.org/The_MBTI_Instrument/Overview.cfm">MBTI Overview</a>). I know this was the trend a few months back, putting your MBTI on your blog and all. I only think it's blogworthy because of the humor derived from seeing M's and mine next to each other. Kinda explains alot though. :)
