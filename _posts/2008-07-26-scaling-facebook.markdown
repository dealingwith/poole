[Facebook VP of technical operations: Jonathan Heiliger][1]

> Jonathan Heiliger, vice president of technical operations at Facebook speaks
to CNET News.com’s Dan Farber about the balancing act between innovating
quickly and building a stable infrastructure at a company moving at breakneck-
speed. Heiliger also discusses what he’s doing to scale data center operations
and support the addition of more than 250,000 customers on a daily basis.

Interesting video for those of us in this business. I've always been impressed
to the point of disbelief that Facebook has scaled a PHP application as
successfully as they have. There is a bit near the end where he talks about
storing data locally that I didn't really catch for the screaming kid, but it
sounded intriguing, at least in the sense that they are thinking/talking about
that option.
