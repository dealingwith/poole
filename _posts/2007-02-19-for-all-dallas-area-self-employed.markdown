Announcing Open Office Hours, every Tuesday and Thursday 9am-6pm...feel free
to come by my place to cozy up to some wifi and coffee and kick some coworking
arse together. I likely won't be chatty, but your presence will be appreciated
for its implicit accountability. Smoking lounge and doggie day care out back
and possibility of a random home cooked meal by another of your coworkers.

[Email me][2] if you are interested but do not yet know where I live.

RSVP with your hours if you want to assure desk space available when you
arrive...but either way we will accommodate you.

Update: Tomorrow I won't be in from about 2:30-4:30, but I think another
coworker will be here so if you want to come you can moil on without me. Also,
on Thursday my housekeeper will be here from 9-12, so you'll have her dusting
your laptop and stuff while you work (just kidding)...
