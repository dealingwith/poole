Last night was dinner at Chuy's, [20x2][1], coffee at the Spider House, and a
lot less beer than prior nights (my body said "no more").

Today I'm once again able to hit ONE session. Interactive kinda hasn't
happened for me this year, due to friends without badges, lame sounding
panels, a "different" schedule (yesterday I slept until 1), and a need to pace
myself in order to get through this whole week. I'm burning out on describing
things, as you might tell. Flickr tells the stories much better anyway.
