[MAKELOVENOTART2][3]

Originally uploaded by [dealingwith][4]

Saw Into The Wild last night and it was **good**, unlike the last movie we
saw, which was made in a [romance factory in China][5]. I _really_ liked it. I
had more to say about it, but I'm in a bit of a rabbit hole consuming more
stuff from around it.

Little updater: [This is the location of the bus][6], and, oh, they have
street view in Fairbanks!

This morning I enjoyed this exchange, because I have the funniest BFF ever:

"How do you know it's time for that? Does the government send you a letter or
something?"

"I think they send it with your menopause check."

I uploaded 2 mp3s for ya, too: [I Hate Your Blog][7] and [It Is Pitch Dark][8]
