<i>just in case u thought i had any time...</i>

<img src="images/rss_folder.jpg" align="left">These are my unread messages from the RSS listserve. RSS is an important topic I need to learn more about as I develop my Dynamic Widget Moving System software. Yeah. This is why musician-photographer-novelists-with-websites developing software and learning a new language tend to end up a post-combustive pile of ash on the living room floor sometime around, oh 6PM on a Thursday.

Meanwhile some past work is paying some dividends--sadly not monetarily, only in a bit of fame equivilant to yesterday's grinds left in the coffee maker overnight.

And oh by the way there are about 250 of you visiting this trash pit last week, so I guess I'll keep writing for you--but please do keep telling yer friends! (ha ha)

"<a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/insight/essays/2002_09_miller.php">My New Church Pt 3</a>" is in the current <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/insight/">Greenbelt Insight</a> roundup. This is slightly more cool these days as they keep less stuff coming through, so it's supposed to be better stuff. But then I know the editor so there you go.

<a href="http://www.next-wave.org/aug02/my_new_church_pt2.htm">My New Pt 2</a>, which caused a stir over at <a href="http://www.next-wave.org/">NW</a> last month (see <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fnextwavefrm21.showMessage?topicID=46.topic">these</a> <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fnextwavefrm21.showMessage?topicID=48.topic">two</a> threads in case yer not caught up {this is all assuming you could give a shit*} ), has already spured <a href="http://www.next-wave.org/sep02/godsword.htm">a retort article</a>, which in turn has already spurred (I don't know how to spell that word so I figured I'd try both once) <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fnextwavefrm21.showMessage?topicID=51.topic">another thread started by some amazingly calm and intelligent person I don't know if I know</a> (if you are reading email me and let me know who u r).

*If you don't give a shit, good. Here are the things that I thought at once hillarious and cool:

<b>1.</b> I'm <i>quoted</i>! WOW! Does this mean I'm legit? After the quote he says:

<i>On the surface, Daniel Miller's article gets points for being clever and sounding cutting edge but... it his comments are neither Biblical, as he casts light on the literal revelation of the Word of God, nor is there anything spiritually productive. First, where is God in the equation of giving and preserving revelation, ala I Peter 1:20? Secondly, the whole comment oozes the same mentality that is being used to present the heresy (gasp!) of the openness of God that teaches God does not know the future and that makes Him so "much more real."</i>

I LOVE IT! (Although I am unsure what "it his" comments are.)

<b>2.</b> Previously, on the aforementioned <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/bnextwave">board</a>, THIS incredible thing was said about me:

<i>I've seen this same article written by about 150 different people on the internet now. When's it going to stop being considered original? We all know this...so let's move on. Or is it the fact that this guy's tight with Coupland and Vonnegut that makes him more than cool?</i>

Damn I wish this were true. Although someone jumping to a conclusion (or are they mocking? oh well, ignorance is bliss) that I'm even remotely in the same camp as <a href="http://www.coupland.com/">Coupland</a> is a great compliment. I also wish I knew who Vonnegut (<a href="http://www.vonnegut.com/">a?</a>) was. 

Someone also referred to me as <i>Sir Miller</i>. Oh shite. They weren't being antagonistic, either...

SO it is an interesting life, isn't it. Everyone go see the new pic up at <a href="http://www.christianpornmachine.com">Christian Porn Machine</a>.

Does anyone watch those old SNL episodes with Mike Myers as the female jewish public access talk show host? The other day I was watching that and he goes:

<i>...Christian Porn Machine is neither christian, porn, or a machine. Discuss...</i>
