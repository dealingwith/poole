- More features isn’t better, it’s worse. 
- You can’t make things easier by
adding to them. 
- Confusion is the ultimate deal-breaker. 
- Style matters 
- Only features that provide a good user experience will be used. 
- Any feature that requires learning will only be adopted by a small fraction of users. 
- Unused features are not only useless, they can slow you down and diminish ease
of use. 
- Users do not want to think about technology: what really counts is
what it does for them. 
- Forget about the killer feature. Welcome to the age
of the killer user-experience. 
- Less is difficult, that’s why less is more
