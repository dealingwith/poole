- More features isn’t better, it’s worse. - You can’t make things easier by
adding to them. - Confusion is the ultimate deal-breaker. - Style matters -
Only features that provide a good user experience will be used. - Any feature
that requires learning will only be adopted by a small fraction of users. -
Unused features are not only useless, they can slow you down and diminish ease
of use. - Users do not want to think about technology: what really counts is
what it does for them. - Forget about the killer feature. Welcome to the age
of the killer user-experience. - Less is difficult, that’s why less is more
