# 無爲

[Wu Wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei) is a Chinese concept that also has representative words in Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. It is an important concept in Taoism. 

> In the Tao Te Ching, it is explained that beings that are wholly in harmony with the Tao behave in a completely natural, uncontrived way. The goal of spiritual practice for the human being is the attainment of this purely natural way of behaving. 

Another concept related to Wu Wei is _effortlessness_. 

Carissa exists magnificently within this way of being. Completely natural, in harmony, uncontrived and effortless are all ways I would describe Carissa. She uses words like happy and grateful, but those feel to me more the _results_ of this way of being. 

Carissa's effortlessness allows her to move through the world and its troubles in a way that has been thusfar unattainable to me; and this is a large part of her attraction. Her natural way exudes a calm sense of trust in the Other that I have never felt. Her contentment with things just the way they are in this moment is astonishing compared to my near-constant, nagging discontent with the world and with others.
