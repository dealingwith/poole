All I want is to have Margot back.

I don't want anything else.

I would give up every penny I have, every penny I will ever have, to have her back.

I would give up everything, every last moment of pleasure, to have her back.

Hell. I would give up all of it for 5 minutes with her.

It's hard to be motivated by desire when your only desire is impossible.
