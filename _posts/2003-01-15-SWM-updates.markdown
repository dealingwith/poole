...fixed a few things that had been broken or that I broke yesterday. If you noticed these and didn't email me, next time just drop me a quick line, eh?



01. old: "view all" under categories did not work in archives (appeared but linked to only "current" blog's categories)

02. yesterday: permalinks broken

03. yesterday: multi-category "support" broken (only effected a few older posts)



...hopefully NOW it runs both a tad faster and works 2boot...



<b>U</b>: 04. and yesterday and for a split minute longer today, "...more words" broken
