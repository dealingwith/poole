Today was a monumental day in the writing career of Daniel Miller. 

He got <em>paid</em>. He got his first ever royalties report. (With the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00007FYBD/qid=1048811482/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-6897918-8080130?v=glance&s=books">other book</a> he did, he just got paid in one lump sum. It was a great take, but he doesn't want to see the sales reports...He'll just thank the Internet bubble and presently stop talking about himself in the third person.)
