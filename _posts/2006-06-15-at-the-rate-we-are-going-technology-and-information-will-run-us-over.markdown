> At the rate we are going, technology and information will run us over,
leaving us nothing more than a small smudge mark in the middle of the road. In
our final days we will look back and wonder where all of our time went over
the years. We will begin to question why we were embedding our very souls into
a system instead of freely embracing life.

> I used to think it was solely the responsibility of an Information Architect
to ensure that our users are not flooded with information. That it was the
IA's job to be the voice of reason and the driving force behind simplifying
the lives of not just users, but people. I was wrong.

> With the thousands of social network sites, blog communities, and web based
applications out there, and the thousands more than join those ranks each day,
the lone IA can no longer be the single force behind the movement for
simplicity and ease of use in information and technology. This job has
extended in the very core of what we do as web professionals and it is now the
job of the designer, the developer, the programmer, the project manager, the
account manager, and the system administrator as well.
