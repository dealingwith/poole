When <a href="http://theyblinked.com">dan</a> <a href="http://www.theyblinked.com/blog/2003_01_12_theyblinked_archive.html#87572994">linked</a> to <a href="http://deepdirt.blogspot.com/2003_01_01_deepdirt_archive.html#90186758">karen's rant</a> yesterday, the main thing that stuck out at me was 



<i>...pre-postmodern born boomers or silents with multiple book contracts and we are not, and don't, so a tiny part of us is jealous...</i>



If I remember correctly, my thought was "Jealous of <i>what</i>?"



Almost blogged about it but didn't feel it worth it <i>until</i> via <a href="http://jordoncooper.com">JordOn</a> I came upon <a href="http://bloggedyblog.blogspot.com/2003_01_12_bloggedyblog_archive.html#90195505">Andrew's rant</a> about trying to get paid from one of his publishers. I can relate! I have no idea if I'm ever going to get paid for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0971457603/qid%3D1042852198/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/102-0133524-5768152">I am Relevant</a>; but since it's a 1/7th share of a low-distribution (only in "specialty stores" as <a href="http://www.michaelknott.com/">Michael Knott</a> once put it) book, I'm not going to sweat it too much, probly. You like what Andrew was owed after, what, a year or two? <b>&#36;200</b>?!?! Yeah, sounds about right.



(I did notice andrew blogged all that right after also linking to karen's rant. I'm assuming that's no coinkidink.)



So yeah, be jealous, go right ahead.
