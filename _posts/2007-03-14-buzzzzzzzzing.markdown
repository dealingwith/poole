I am so happy right now and so grateful that I have been given a life so open
to serendipity and experience.

It's been a good day. What I can tell you: my drum kit, or about half of it
anyway, is on its way to Austin right now. [Andy Zipf][1] called me a few
hours ago, an hour out of Dallas, recently informed that the promised back
line for [his SXSW show Friday][2] had not materialized. His drummer is flying
in from LA. So they swung by, packed the kit up, and he, Shawn and I stood out
front of my house and talked shop for two hours. And...I'm on the list +1 for
the show. Anyone want to go to Austin? :)
