[Are cats for true Christians? Is it appropriate for a Christian to own a cat,
in light of their past pagan religious affiliation and the medical information
that is now coming to light?][1]

> First, let us consider what most scholars agree is the etymology (word
derivation) for the English term 'cat'. ...'a contemporary housecat with all
of its beastly identifying characteristics and behavior.' A faithful servant
of Jehovah would quickly notice that the nature of a cat is so marked as being
'beastly'. The Bible makes clear reference to this condition when describing
parts of Satan's organizations, both past and present.

...Clearly, the Bible - by using this kind of terminology - shows beyond any
reasonable doubt that the basic nature of cats, while created perfect by God,
has become evil or 'beastlike' since the fall of Adam six thousand years ago
