Tonight I saved out maps of my various single and multiplayer Minecraft worlds. (Maps link to full size.)

First, the map I've been playing for years, the very first map I ever played in vanilla Minecraft. I hadn't played this map in a long time but recently started playing it again:

Second, the second vanilla Minecraft map I played, again years old but not quite as old. My intent was to start fresh but with more experience playing the game:

Third, my last singleplayer world, a modded instance. I actually intended to create an adventure map by hand in survival Minecraft. Not sure what I was thinking:

At Minecraft U, we typically reset our servers every year. I don't have previous years' maps, but here are this years' creative and ComputerCraft survival worlds:

Finally, some screenshots, first just the kind of random stuff that makes the worlds of Minecraft so interesting:

...and two screenshots from our Minecraft U creative server:
