Whenever I need perspective I go find [this photograph](http://www.flickr.com/photos/carissabyers/4779129420/). It is the greatest regret of my life, leaving behind for even one second the daughter who would one month later be taken from me.

When I go to work these days Lucy says *"Come back. Miss you."* and leans in plaintively for a kiss. 

When I get home from work these days Lucy says *"Yay! Daddy home! Best Daddy ever!"*

In fact she does this whole thing where she'll exchange endearing exclamations with us:

> Best Mommy ever!

> Best Lucy ever!

> No, best Mommy EVER!

She plays drums and [Paper Jamz guitar](http://instagram.com/p/kfxeygIhg4/).

She says *"Baby Milo in Mommy's tummy."*

She eats dinner by 5:30 most days, which means I don't share that meal with my family, a first in our many years of existence. I don't know how to fix that. I have responsibilities and stuff, not the least of which is providing for my family. But Lucy and I will often get about a half an hour together in the mornings. I get home from dropping off Penn at school and she intercepts me on my way to the computer or shower and says, "Come play my room." Who am I to disobey?
