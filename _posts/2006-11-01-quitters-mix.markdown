[![][1]][2]

the mix i promised a week ago. so many songs have been on and off this mix.
it's silly.

still mixed feelings about...well, just about everything. i feel like i just
jumped off a moving train and i'm still getting used to...er...not being on
the train anymore. my week has been consumed with a shitload of todo list
items and partying really hard.

see you in Canada.
