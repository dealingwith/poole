Last weekend I did the Texas Chainring Massacre gravel ride. I did the 30 mile "fun" ride. It was windy and cold. It was fun.

I'm not a very good gravel rider. I'm not in very good shape right now. I don't like it when the gravel is really just rocks. But the weather has been nice (besides the wind) lately (today was a just-armwarmers day, my favorite temperature for riding) and it's good to have some variety besides the usual White Rock Lake / East Dallas routes.
