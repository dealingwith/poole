..._introducing_ constraints. If a project sponsor asks for 4 features, we
give them 2, they want 10 we promise 5. ...etc.

This helps us:

  * Control feature creep

  * Keep scope manageable

  * Prevent over-architecting our solutions

  * Deliver sooner

  * Prevent building features the end users really didn't need

  * Allow for better focus

  * Force attention to the "big rocks" of the problem

  * Allow for social solutions where technological solutions are not necessary
or appropriate (so we're never the ones suggesting we spam or disable basic
browser functions)

  * Prevent our tools from becoming solutions looking for problems
