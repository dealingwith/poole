[danielsjourney][1]'s margins just got fixed in IE7. No idea what it looks
like in IE6. But really, anyone who uses IE probably doesn't care about what
web sites look like. ([This is what it's supposed to look like][2].) (Your OS-
specific font/text treatments may vary.) Still can't figure out what's wrong
with its list item bullets being not at all centered on the first line of list
text, or why the list bullets don't show up at all in the menu. But there is
basically no styling other than the bullet graphic change out going on there,
and I don't even know if you can move around a bullet to get it to line up any
better than the browser does by default.

Now on to [johnnycitizen.com][3]. That one has more issues, where I get
_really_ annoyed that IE doesn't support fixed elements very well. I'm
basically going to just start over there.
