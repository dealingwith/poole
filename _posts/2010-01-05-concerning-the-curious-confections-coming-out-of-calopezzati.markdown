Dear Editor:

I knew my [short airing of grievances][1] might stir some feathers, but I had
no idea what strange and oddly delicious consequence it would have. It seems
that an unusual alliance formed shortly after your publishing the piece on
December 30th. Two parties heretofore only acquaintances via strange gender-
biased clothing-optional soirees and otherwise only linked in their previous
friendship with yours truly and thenceforth hatred of the same seem to have
linked together to express their distaste for my rhetoric by engaging in
industrial baking. I was greeted this morning at my door by a package of
unknown origins. Having just been released from some kind of low-security
prison I expected it to be some of my belongings I might have left behind, but
instead discovered a box of gold-wrapped cylindrical chocolate wafers. I
instinctively unwrapped one and took a bite, before I realized the inside of
the wrapper was imprinted with slanderous quotes about me! I was, of course,
instantly concerned that the pastry might be poisoned, but having already
taken a bite I was forced to simply wait it out and after the course of many
minutes I decided that was not the case. They were in fact quite tasty. But as
I read the vile words attacking my character that had sat so closely to the
sweetness of the sugary goodness, I was left with a deep sense of contention
within.
