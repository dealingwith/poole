[Seduction of the Cyber Zombies][1]:

> Only the most extropian true believers in the Net still dream of it as the
final solution. More realistic thinkers have rejected cyber-soteriology, but
accept the Net as a viable tool (or weapon). They would agree that other nets
must be set up and maintained simultaneously with "the" Net---otherwise it
becomes just another medium of alienation, more engrossing than TV, maybe, but
thereby even more total in entrancement.

I didn't get much farther along in this essay (maybe later), but this said
what I wanted to say.
