I once said to the leader the community where I'm not really welcome anymore:

> I'm a prophet. I throw the grenade into the church. You're the pastor. You
lead everyone to the bomb shelter.

It was obviously a metaphor relating to ways-of-thinking not behavior or
anything otherwise. Just now I was looking at [an old sermon of mine][1] and
found this, from Richard Rohr's _Everything Belongs_:

> The prophet leads us into sacred space by showing us the insufficiency of
the old order; the role of the priest is to teach us how to live in the new
realm.

I'm not sure which version of the same statement I prefer (probably mine,
being a rather proud person), but I like this additional validation of my oft-
despised position in like communities:

> Unfortunately, the priest too often operates separately from the prophet. He
talks of a new realm but never leads us out of the old order where we are
still largely trapped. (Such priesthood is ineffective, though quite popular.)

While I'm on the topic, here are a couple video posts worth revisiting for the
occasion: [Jogging For Jesus][2] and [Parts of the Body][3].
