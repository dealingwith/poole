I left a comment on one of his pictures about his contradicting licensing. I
wish I had kept the text of it, because he deleted it. I was withholding
future wrath, hoping he had updated [his license on flickr][2]. He hasn't.
Take a look at one of his pictures. Look at the awesome text he superimposes
over the image. Look at the caption. Look at the TITLE for fuck's sake. And
then he chooses a Creative Commons license through flickr. And I bring this
problem to his attention. And he does nothing. Wang. Ker.

How do I know of this problem? Because I'm creating a public art project that
pulls CC-licensed images from flickr and mashes them together. And I was
served one of his (supposedly) CC'd images, and got AWESOME Copyright text
across my composite.

There's stupid like the Target cashier who takes a space-out break in-between
customers when he has a huge line during Christmas time. Then there's this.
