It's just that choice is so powerful.

We can choose to put our hearts aside. We've let them choose for themselves
for too long, perhaps. We can give them a room upstairs, slip bread and water
under the door. Maybe a book. Maybe a trashy gossip magazine.

We can choose to behave. Our mouths forming words, sentences filled with more
lies than any we have ever dared breathe. "How are you?" "Good."

And we will, if it be your will. Goddess of this land, director of your
creation. We are the people of Her pasture and the sheep of Her hand.
