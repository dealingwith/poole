It's just that choice is so powerful.

We can choose to put our hearts aside. We've let them choose for themselves for too long, perhaps. We can give them a room upstairs, slip bread and water under the door. Maybe a book. Maybe a trashy gossip magazine.

We can choose to behave. Our mouths forming words, sentences filled with more lies than any we have ever dared breathe.

"How are you?"

"Good."

And we will, if it be your will. Goddess of this land, director of your creation. We are the people of Her pasture and the sheep of Her hand.
