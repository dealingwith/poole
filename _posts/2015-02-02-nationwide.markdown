> ...we can't make safe happen because we don't live in a safe world. The ad warns about preventable accidents. You know what? Most accidents are considered preventable when viewed in hindsight. That's why they are called 'accidents' not 'inevitables'. But the dangers that lurk aren't products of our failure, they are symptoms of mortality. And no matter how much we try, at the end of the day all we can do is guard against a state of being that will, despite our very best efforts, eventually hurt and take some of our babies. This isn't anyone's fault. Moms and Dads, this isn't your fault.

I didn't watch a second of the super bowl, but couldn't avoid the news about the disgusting Nationwide insurance commercial. I watched it today and the negative emotional effects on me have been profound. The blog post above says it better than I could.
