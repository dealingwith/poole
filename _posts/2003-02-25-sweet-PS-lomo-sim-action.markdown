I linked to the lomo vs. coolpix thing a few days ago, what I never ended up linking to was <a href="http://www.redscreen.net/photolog/">this rad photoblog</a> (found via <a href="http://kottke.org">kottke</a>) which has <a href="http://www.redscreen.net/photolog/fun.html">tutorial</a> on how to do a fakie lomo effect in Photoshop...and not only a tutorial, but an <a href="http://www.redscreen.net/photolog/files/LomoEffects.atn">action file</a> for you downloading and abusing pleasure! How cool! (I link straight to the action file because you <em>will</em> want to go check out the site anyway.) (<a href="http://benbubar.blogspot.com/">Ben</a> u r particularly stoked.) Anyway, if you don't know how to use actions, like I didn't, just look in the Photoshop help file; it's easy. Anyway-anyway, here's the results with a shot I took yesterday:
