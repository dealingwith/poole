First off, <strong><a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2005/03/yahoo_actually_.html">holy shite</a>!</strong> At the <a href="index.php?file=2005_03.xml&id=13191538">The New New Economy</a> panel at Sx, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/03/13.html#a9618">somebody</a> asked Caterina Fake<blockquote>...whether it was true that Flickr has been sold to Yahoo. She didn't deny or confirm, but she said in front of the crowd at SXSW "I'm gonna kick the ass of the next person who asks me that question."</blockquote>

Tonight went to see <strong><a href="http://www.kingsofconvenience.com/">Kings of Convenience</a></strong> at the Gypsy Tea Room. I had high <a href="http://127.0.0.1/webdev/integration/daniel/blog/index.php?file=2005_02.xml&id=06163547">expectations brewin</a>g over the course of months, and they did NOT disappoint! Last night a friend called me immediately after seeing them in Austin (Sx) and told me to try and chat with the band before the show, because they pulled a drummer from the audience in Austin to play "Dance With You." We were sitting in the back during Feist (the opener/sings on KoC songs), and sure enough Erlend comes to the back and sits in the sound booth for a bit. I just walked over and thanked him blah blah blah told him about my friend calling me and telling me about the drummer thing...he said, "Ah...but we don't have a drumkit tonight," and scratched his head. I said well the Austin show went over really well blah blah blah...he said maybe 10 words to me total and I skidaddled back to my seat.
