			Love



Why is love such a hard thing to obtain, such a hard thing to grab, a dandelion seed floating in the air, 
moving just out of reach with every stab into the empty atmosphere. We know of its value, we know all the clich&eacute;s, we know what to say, we know we like it (a lot). But we can never grab it. As I look around at the world and wonder how we can treat each other this way, every day I live in a microcosm which shows me that I, above all, am unable to even attempt such a lofty goal, failing every day in my better intentions, instead succumbing to my own needs, desires, expectations, insecurities, inabilities. 



I am most definitely the one billionth person to ask "How do we love?" It's a question that will never be completely answered despite a world full of pat answers anywhere from "Jesus is Love" to "Just Do It." Perhaps living in the tension of that question and its non-answer is, after it is all said and done, the essence of life itself.



<i>I've seen your flag on the marble arch

but love is not a victory march

it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah



well, maybe there's a god above

but all I've ever learned from love

was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you

it's not a cry that you hear at night

it's not somebody who's seen the light

it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah</i>
