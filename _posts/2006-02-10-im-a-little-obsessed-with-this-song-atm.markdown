Nobody Gets a Smooth Ride (S.Hindalong, T.Chandler)

Nobody gets a smooth ride… Every child will learn How the asphalt burns When
he takes a sharp turn too wide Nobody gets a smooth ride

I’m really sorry the way things are going these days Try to be careful that’s
all I can say I’m really sorry the way things are going

Civilians needn’t wear guns… Bullets rain on us The hapless populace Fools
will shoot the sky just for fun Civilians needn’t wear guns

I’m really sorry the way things are going these days Try to be careful that’s
all I can say I’m really sorry the way things are going

High flyers oughta use nets… Hold on tight to the bar Circus trapeze star What
a shame should you fall to your death High flyers oughta use nets

I’m really sorry the way things are going… Nobody gets a smooth ride
