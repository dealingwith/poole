soon after my last post i slept again for three hours. when i woke up i was in
big trouble...my legs and my head were in a lot of pain, and the cough was
more present and more painful.

i don't have a couch or TV or anything to distract me but my computer, which
sucks only in moments like these. i managed to find something to listen to and
also walk the dog.

also i had those really bad fever shivers, took my temp and it was 99.3. kept
having to turn the heat up more and more.

went to bed with all the blankets i own. tried to get the dog to lay on the
corner of the bed with me but since he's a total retard he had to lay RIGHT
NEXT to me and start biting his own butt, which just ain't gonna fly so he
went back to his kennel where he still remains (trying to get the energy to
walk him).

so i sweat like crazy; i'd wake up and my shirt was completely soaked in
sweat, but if i let any air under the covers at all i froze. also last night
was some big thing across the street, and those things have gotten really loud
and go later and later. finally the band and the crowd wrapped things up
around 3.45, but then at 4.15 someone, i assume coming out of minc, had to
blare their car stereo and sing really loud along to it, some latin music. i
assume they were parked right in front of my space for it to be that loud.

this is part of the reason why i'm so over living here.

i think i'm going to shower and walk the dog and take more nyquil and go back
to sleep. i still have the sweats which is getting annoying.
