Things are good.

[Art Conspiracy][1] is* tomorrow night. Come out and etc etc. I'm a
contributing artist this year and am fairly pleased with my piece,
_especially_ compared to what I did for Art Conspiracy 1 (last year I took a
miss) (I'm only a visual artist every other year).

Next time someone asks me how [The HopeShow][3] is going to make money, I'm
going to tell them that I charge a quarter every time someone asks me that
question. We'll be sipping Pi√±a Coladas in the Caribbean in no time.

* (according to the website copy) going to _Ignite_ in Dallas, and the 100
Local Artists and Bands are going to _Conspire, Combine, and React_. I guess
as long as I don't have to _Synergize_ I'll be ok.

** The internets has mades me very excessives with the plurals.
