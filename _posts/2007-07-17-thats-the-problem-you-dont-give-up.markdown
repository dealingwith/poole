> That's the problem. You don't give up. You've got your entire world
imprinted on your brain, and nothing will change it. Keep yourself tidy, don't
play with yourself, get a decent education and a good job, tuck something away
for a rainy day, play football, respect the police, find a good woman, teach
your children who's boss, buy a good house, don't fight in public, keep away
from religion and above all, don't fuck your wife's sister. And all the time
your soul is dying like a child trapped in a refrigerator.
