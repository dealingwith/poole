Last night I was at this pub. We had a great nite laughing and drinking and
talking. Then towards the end, I was pretty lit, I made this joke about being
the only guy there who wasn't or hadn't already been laid that day. This one
girl, who up to that point had seemed tolerable in a faux-intelligence kind of
way, freaked out and declared her offence and disgust at my comment.

Fine. I apologized, my overly-sensitive 90% going into hypermode, not wanting
to offend.

She did not accept the apology and remained indignantly upset.

"Fuck you" is my general response to those who won't accept a sincere apology
for trival matters.

But on the way home I thought, since when is sex an off-limits comment at the
pub? I've heard so many people, men and women, say much more horrible things
that what I said so many times, I can't tell you.

Besides my joke was more an honest expression of frustration at a lack of true
intimacy. Accuse me of being a misogynist if you like, but I am more
respectful of women than most men I know.

Anyway, she was totally like OMG I'm a Sexually Repressed Bitch, that's all I
know.
