The Antipocalypse 1.1][2] is out. ([Part 1 was mentioned here][3].)

> "But this time we could do it right! I mean, did you read about that new
network they're installing in New Beijing?"

"Beijing is a fiefdom! And you know those Chilaskans--give them one printing
press and all they'll produce is propaganda."

"Or the monetary system in the Nordics?"

"What's next? An arms race? 'Language should be angelic, instead it is
infected with a virus,'" Johnny was poorly quoting anarchists again, "If we
require another Hermes to carry our messages, he'll eventually get bored and
kill our cows, leaving us hungry and very pissed off."
