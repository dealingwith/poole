> When making a decision, have a meeting if you're optimizing for speed, write first if optimizing for quality.

> Good decisions require clear thinking. Clear thinking requires sitting with the problem to understand it deeply, which writing forces you to confront what decision is being made, the tradeoffs, and downstream second+ order impact.

> Synchronous decision making optimizes for speed, guided by intuition, pattern matching, and mental heuristics. It seems effective because it feels efficient, but it does not yield same results.
