Today I found out [Nic Hughes](http://hauntedgeographies.typepad.com/) lost his ongoing fight with cancer. He was a loved husband, father, friend, designer and thinker. He was barely older than I. He was a peer and an idol at once. After Margot's death he wrote me:

> Dear Daniel,
> I think we’ve briefly met once and have occasionally exchanged email and comments from time to time. I talked to Steve at Greenbelt and he confirmed what I suspected from your twitter feed--that Margot did not make it.

> I have no way of understanding this or coming close to your experience, apart from, that I have kids too. In the end, words are completely inadequate. This is to show solidarity and say that I’m thinking of you in this unfathomable moment of loss.

> Hope this is not too invasive? Take care,
> Nic Hughes

On the way home from the office, where I was when I heard, I was somehow drawn to memories of a host of those we've lost. I found myself listening to [Carter](http://www.carteralbrecht.com/)'s record. I happened to drive by where earlier this year we saw [a teenage girl killed](/2012/01/01/rapha/).

Later, in reply to my helpless email of remorse, our mutual friend [Kester](http://www.kesterbrewin.com/) replied:

> From afar, with the dignity and rage with which you dealt with your loss, you've already been such a help.

It's hard to conceive of the fact that my own suffering gives space for others', but I guess it is true. While I cannot create a narrative that accounts for our loss of Nic...while I only recently, in a moment of personal reflection, discounted all narratives that gave meaning to our loss of Margot...in it lies a bit of something that provides some meaning to others. As I discovered today, Nic once wrote me:

> Narrative is gold.

Amen to that, and godspeed, Nic.

Here is something I recorded for Nic (as requested of many by his friends before his passing). It might give you a little insight into what Nic meant to me:
