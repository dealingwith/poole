My friends from Albuquerque, [*Lousy Robot*](http://music.lousyrobot.com/), were in town last night and I rather enjoyed their set of music at the Double Wide. I had a lot of profound thoughts during the show but I must have washed them all away with IPA. Simply put: music is awesome. 

Dandee really enjoys playing and it shows when he is on stage. The world could do for a few more musicians like Dandee and a few more bands like Lousy Robot.
