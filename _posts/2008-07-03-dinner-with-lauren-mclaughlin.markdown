[Senses Five Press][1]

> Storytelling is the foundation of any good novel and I think it's actually a
very rare talent. Plenty of writers get by on killer premises and witty style.
But effective storytelling is all about structure. It's very mechanical,
almost architectural. When you can marry that structure to a framework of
ideas, then the novel can transcend pure entertainment. The trick, in my
opinion, is to weave these ideas invisibly into the story so that they are
discovered, unraveled by the reader. My goal is to seduce my reader into a
compelling narrative that whittles away at some preconceived idea and leaves
them with an uncomfortable but somehow intriguing gap in their sense of the
world.

[Her site][2] looks rather interesting -- a blog that mentions cheese, music
that is described as from robots, and podcasts. Hopefully I'll someday have
time to check out stuff like this again.
