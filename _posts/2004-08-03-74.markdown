[The Beta Band Break Up][1]

_In the statement, bassist Richard Greentree described the decision as a
culmination of problems, rather than a direct reaction to poor record sales:
"The Beta Band apple has over-ripened and become riddled with maggots, it must
fall from the tree and let its seeds return to the ground." While the breakup
is indeed sad news for rock music, fans of long-winded metaphors shall
certainly rejoice._
