[Prayin' For You][1]

Guitars, vocals, drums: Daniel Miller Bass, keys: Salim Nourallah Backing
vocal: [Michele Pittenger][2]

I totally feel like a hypocrite with this song atm, as i'm praying for myself
the way i was hypothetically praying for the person who originally inspired
this song...alas...

Michele came out today and blessed this song with her beautiful pipes*, the
only remaining touch required for this simple song. We had completed
everything else last week (as well as most of another song that is still in
process, but that Michele also sang on today).

*at first I couldn't think of any female singers I knew in Dallas. Then I
remembered Michele, who I only knew tangentially. Very excited.

[Pete Rollins on desire][3] (only 125k)

I've been thinking alot lately about taking people for granted. I was re-
listening to Pete Rollins' talk from Greenbelt last year and this bit stuck
out at me. Common sense, but the bit that I took away was to make our
relationships with other people religious experiences. To make our
understanding and experience of them hyperanonymous. *heheh*

There's more there, but I've got to go and my brain hasn't put all the bits
together. Everything is true and nothing is true.
