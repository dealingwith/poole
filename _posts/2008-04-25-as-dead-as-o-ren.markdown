[...as dead as O-Ren][3]

Originally uploaded by [eschipul][4]

> As I said before, I've allowed you to keep your wicked life for two reasons.
And the second reason is so you can tell him in person everything that
happened here tonight. I want him to witness the extent of my mercy by
witnessing your deformed body. I want you to tell him all the information you
just told me. I want him to know what I know. I want him to know I want him to
know. And I want them all to know they'll all soon be as dead as O-Ren.
