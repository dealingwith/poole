  * [Edward Tufte][1] ...the guru of Information Design

  * [Data Visualization: Modern Approaches][2] on Smashing Magazine

  * [flowingdata.com][3] ..."FlowingData explores how designers,
statisticians, and computer scientists are using data to understand ourselves
better - mainly through data visualization."

  * A friend pointed me to [this portfolio][4] (Scroll down to
"experimental".)

  * [This guy is getting a lot of press lately][5]

  * and of course don't forget about [indexed][6]

  * via one of the above: [these look yummy][7]

  * [BIG tree maps][8]

These all came across my desk in the last week--something about [attention][9]
and having attended the Tufte seminar Monday--and I thought I would catalog
them here and shareâ€¦
