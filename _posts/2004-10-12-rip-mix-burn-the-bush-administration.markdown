I already spoke my peace about Creative Commons, and have yet to implement a CC license on any DJDC content. But for once I don't want to have to give individual permissions to mess with my IP. I want as many people as possible remixing this shit, re-writing it, re-record the whole thing, just use the words in some random thing, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THIS TRACK, make money on it, license your new shit any way you want, all you have to do is stick my name on it somewhere: the following song is <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license</a>:

_The Bush Administration_

I actually wrote this song a few months ago, but I've just recently returned to my <a href="http://www.korg.com/gear/info.asp?a_prod_no=D12&category_id=3">D12</a> to cut demos. While I like this tune, it's not the kind of thing I can do much with on my own, and I wanted it out there before elections. So I threw this mix together pretty quick (I throw all my demos together quickly due to some subconscious utilitarian taskmaster who tells me it's a waste of time), hoping the world wide interwebbie could make use of it before it's too late.

Here are the lyrics and an approximation of the chords for _The Bush Administration_

E - B - A - B - E - B - A - G
E - B - A - B - E - B - A - G - F#
I made you, I'll break you
I made you and I will destroy your life
2x

E - B - F# - G
Power corrupts
Ridiculous power corrupts ridiculously
2x

I love you, die for me
I love you, die for me and my bank account
2x

chorus:
It's not lying, it's not deception
It's creative use of the truth
2x

~~Here are the individual tracks (just one guitar and one vocal) for those who know what to do with such things (and if you need a better copy, just contact me)...please don't listen to the vocal only track just for shits and giggles (so embarrassing!)~~

Well interwebbie, I didn't abort this thing, I decided to pop it out, so now give it a good, loving home (where it can grow) will you!
