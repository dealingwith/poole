So Wednesdays at 2 at the City Pub there is live jazz. Once my snare drum gets here from DC I will be sitting in with these cats. Until then I will be enjoying their performances, tuning my ears, getting used to their timing.

I don't know why, but I love the image of a stand-up bass.



On the way home I snapshot this guy begging in old town. He has the most classic features I've ever seen in such an old man.
