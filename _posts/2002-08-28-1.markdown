back. very sick. this may mean i'll be online alot because i can't move from my chair, or it might meen i won't get to this thing again until next week, because i'm sick and have a million and a half things to do before sunday.

the funny thing was i was totally fine until about a minute after i got on the plane, then symptoms that normally come one at a time...sore throat, coughing, faucet nose...came all at once in a hurry and making up for lost time.
