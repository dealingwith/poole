title: 'Off to PDX and XOXO'
---

Tomorrow morning I fly to Portland for the XOXO Festival. This will be my third year attending (so far, all of them). It will be my first XOXO trip without my family along with me and my first longer trip away from Lucy since she was born almost three years ago (I've been on short trips to CA and OK). 

I haven't left yet but I'm already feeling a lot of anxiety about being away. I'm hoping we can both adjust. But I'm more worried about myself.
