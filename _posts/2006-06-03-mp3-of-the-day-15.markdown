[![][1]Self Help Serenade, by Marjorie Fair][2], is a damn good record for
$0.01 plus shipping. Comes out to about two fiddy; still six fiddy less than
the local used record store's best prices. This is a http://pandora.com/ find.
I think I've blogged about Pandora already, something to the effect of it
rocking my world. It also is fun to find really cheap, good records on Amazon
through it. I've found two and that was just from one day of use. (I actually
don't get to use Pandora that much, despite loving it. I have a lot of music
in my life right now and hate to neglect any of it.)

Anyhoo, get to the mp3 already I can hear my other personality saying.

but seriously, buying the record used off amazone is less work than
downloading the mp3.
