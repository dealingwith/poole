<b>Imagining</b>
<i>Why do all the good women and photographs come from East Europe?</i>

I had stopped "re-blogging" things from <a href="http://consumptive.org/weblog/blog.html">consumptive</a>, since I figured you were, by now, either a fan or not. But this one I have to post, because it is a Czech:

The images are amazing. Do check it out.

And this reminds me that I want to get crackin' on scanning images from my father-in-law. He gave me a book of black and white photographs he took during his teens and twenties all over Slovakia (mostly Bratislava) that are really quite fantastic (this is me not trying to use the word amazing twice in one post). I've been meaning to scan them and get them on the web. Now I have more impetus. Be on the lookout for that as well.
