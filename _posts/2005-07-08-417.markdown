SO...I haven't written a song all year and I just sat down with some lyrics in
my head and no decent music came out whatsoever.....................I am
REALLY in a creative slump at the moment...no output to speak of this year.
I'm thinking of canning everything but the writing...the new DJDC tagline
could be "writer of words and code" or somesuch. And the weird shit I'm doing.
The "alternative universe" thing. I registered yet another URL last night...

AnyHOO...music...yeah...listening...not writing or performing...should I just
succumb?

also: CAN'T GET ENOUGH of the new Mountain Goats and Sufjan Stevens...OMG
