Jenny woke up with something new (to her) on the brain. She swung her legs
gingerly out from under the duvet and spread her toes on the hardwoods. With a
brief detour to press the coffeemaker's "on" button, she settled at the
computer. The Idea Copyright Database website was in her bookmarks, her search
query submitted within seconds and with nary a touch of the mouse. The
annoying "please wait" graphic a throwback to 2007, when the (then called)
Apple computer popularized the hypnotic spinner. Government websites were
always a solid decade behind the times. "This thing gets slower every damn
day," she mumbled under her breath, and stood to retrieve a cup of tasty
caffeine.

_1004 results matched your request..._ "Shit," Jenny thought, "not specific
enough yet," and sipped her coffee faster in an attempt to facilitate the
process. She only had 15 minutes before she had to start getting ready for
work. She managed two more keywords and searched within the results. This
brought the list to a manageable two pages' worth. She scanned the abstracts
and clicked through to a couple. Finally, towards the bottom of the second
page she found what she was secretly hoping not to (having long ago stopped
worrying about the ironic causality of the process). She mumbled some
obscenities and clicked through to the Execution Permits. Already a three-year
with two more years left on it, and three more in the queue.

"These," more obscenities, "people," Jenny said loud enough to elicit a groan
and some rustling from her lover, still in the bed. "They need this shit like
so many trophies on their shelf. What would they talk about at parties? How
would they know how to feel about themselves, how to rate their self esteem
against all the other similarly-but-not-too-similarly-now dressed people in
their precious little peer groups? Oh, I'm sorry: _communities_. What ever
would the world do without their precious little ideas, codified by Big
Brother for all to see."

"Oh, for the days when a freakin' domain registration was as far as these
nascent mental masturbations need freakin' go, when there were actually
[TLD][1]s to be had."
