<a href="http://www.chuckpalahniuk.net/books/nonfiction/hempel.htm">She Breaks Your Heart</a>

by <a href="http://www.chuckpalahniuk.net">Chuck Palahniuk</a>

from <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/">LA Weekly</a>, Sep 20-26, 2002



Where Chuck gushes about <em>his</em> fav author, and gives us a lesson in minimalism all at once.



<em>Oh, and in minimalism, no abstracts. No silly adverbs like sleepily, irritably, sadly, please. And no measurements, no feet, yards, degrees or years-old. The phrase "an 18-year-old girl" -- what does that mean? 



In The Harvest, Hempel writes, "The year I began to say vahz instead of vase, a man I barely knew nearly accidentally killed me."</em>



<em>...Amy Hempel does this. Instead of telling us the boyfriend in The Harvest is an asshole, we see him holding a sweater soaked with his girlfriend's blood and telling her, "You'll be okay, but this sweater is ruined."</em>

<img src="http://kiosk.mdlf.org/imgbank/image-U7LA2WUQZL.jpg" alt="" align="left">....meanwhile <a href="/miriam">Miriam</a> is on her second book <i>written in Bosnian</i>. Hello! It is comprised of stories from the seige of Sarajevo. The cover shows (I pressume) the author, typing by candlelight. Next November I plan on participating in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">national novel writing month</a>; I hope that life will be settled and organized enough at that point to do so. And I plan on getting myself a nice old typewriter, one where you can feel the key engage under your fingers and that makes a loud *crack* noice with each letter. And I plan on writing, if not some new idea, then at least the <a href="http://www.danielsjourney.com/index.php?archive=blog_2003_01_17.xml&id_pass=209">Newspaperwoman</a>. And maybe at night I'll turn off all the lights and light a couple candles to write by, in memory of the time we missed.
