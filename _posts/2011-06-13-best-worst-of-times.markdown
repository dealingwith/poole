title: "Best of Times, Worst of Times"
---

I should warn you, [this story](https://themoth.org/stories/the-best-of-times-the-worst-of-times) by Anthony Griffith is intense. The title does not do it justice; but then no title could. I'm not sure what prompted me to listen to it on my drive home from work today. I'm also not sure how I managed to drive through the tears. But I'm glad I did. It was very cathartic and he put into words so many things I've wished I could put into words here. I found myself shouting over my sobs, "Yes. Yes. Yes."
