...thanks for humoring me...

I was sad to no longer have [Divvy](https://mizage.com/divvy/) to arrange all my windows, and was getting by with GNOME's side-by-side window snapping. Then I found [gtile](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/28/gtile/)! And I continue to forget it is installed and just use GNOME's window management. I did remap win+up to full height instead of maximize. I like my text editor relatively narrow.

The other thing I struggled with was a Markdown previewer! I was surprised to find this lacking. I used [Marked](https://marked2app.com/) on Mac. I have [Typora](https://www.typora.io/), which is great, but I still prefer a text editor for writing (because I'm old). [Atom](https://atom.io/) has a built-in Markdown preview but it's apparently currently broken on Linux. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has plentiful Markdown prevew plugins but the editor itself is just ok. I'm not sure what my beef is with it. And on Linux the menus flash a white box before they render which is a no go. My editor, Sublime Text, doesn't have any good Markdown previews, and given how everyone is moving to VS Code I kind of doubt it will get one. I ended up installing the [Markdown Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk) Chrome extension and it works great. Who knew.

Battery life is terrible, which I forgot to mention in my [last post](http://www.daniel.industries/2020/07/11/my-linux-setup/). I need to figure it out for next time. Not sure if it's hardware or the OS. While I'm stuck at home it's not a big deal.
