I love this video. It is simple yet powerful. And it is exactly how I've been feeling lately.

I posted it on Facebook somewhere around 6-9 months ago but it's more applicable now. Or maybe just the arrows change. Either way I wanted to capture it here, in my space, especially now that my FB account is no longer.

I like that the last lyrics, which are in French, proclaim:

> A great hope has crossed the land  
> A great hope has crossed fear

--- 

> The lyrics mainly suggest the idea that missing someone--pining--can be a physical pain much like hunger.
