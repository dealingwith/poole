Consider what that cartoon _means_ in that context: It implies that the
commenter feels—with some irony and self-awareness, I'm sure—that his opinion,

marry a particular woman. This is, for many obvious reasons, completely
insane. And yet there was an image already sketched and available to that
commenter so that he could express this exact sentiment of _choosing not to be
outraged at a situation he read about on the Internet_. WWIC in action.
