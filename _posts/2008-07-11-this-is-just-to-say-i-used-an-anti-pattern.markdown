[Anti-pattern][1]

> In [software engineering][2], an **anti-pattern** (or **antipattern**) is a
[design pattern][3] that appears obvious but is ineffective or far from
optimal in practice.

>

> The term was coined in 1995 by [Andrew Koenig][4], inspired by Gang of
Four's book _[Design Patterns][5]_, which developed the concept of [design
patterns][3] in the software field. The term was widely popularized three
years later by the book _[AntiPatterns][6]_, which extended the use of the
term beyond the field of software design and into general [social
interaction][7].

This came up at work today.

[This Is Just To Say][8], via [and older This American Life episode][9] I just
got around to listening to today (yay podcasting).
