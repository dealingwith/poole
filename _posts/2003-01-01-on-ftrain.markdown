Probably my favorite writer on the web, who had a quiet December, on the coming year:



<i>So what comes next? Right now it's a sour feeling, but the year is still full of narrative and personal possibilities, despite an inauspicious beginning. This being New Year's, and I being here alone with <a href="http://www.ftrain.com">Ftrain</a> and a lot of ambition, I will, simply, continue to resolve, and improve my resolution - my dots per inch, my steadfastness, my declarations, my telescopic vision.</i>
