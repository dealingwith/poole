> The umlaut became de rigueur for a whole host of bands, ranging from
Motörhead to Queensryche (which impossibly put it over the “Y”), and it was
typically added as an afterthought, a hollow symbol of distinction that owed

notes that when Mötley Crüe played Germany, the literal-minded crowd chanted
“Mutley Cruh”).
