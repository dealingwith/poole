Just a couple links for you today:

<a href="http://www.scissorkick.com/">scissorkick.com</a>, a beautifully-designed music blog with very nice taste in the mp3 sharing department indeed.

<a href="http://spreadin.blogspot.com/">new(ish)</a>, another discerning music blog. look for the Clinic tracks (June 28) from a record not due out until the fall.

both of these have something to do with <a href="http://www.bastardjazz.com/">bastardjazz.com</a>.

while i'm scoring you the music love, also check out <a class="dead">betterpropaganda.com (dead link)</a>, <a class="dead">lastlifemedia.com (dead link)</a>, and <a href="http://33.verbosecoma.com/">33 revolutions per minute</a>.
