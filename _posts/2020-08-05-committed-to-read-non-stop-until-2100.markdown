I have 6701 articles in my Pocket read later list.

I have a reading list database in Notion. It has 302 unread books on it. 52 of those I have in my possession in one form or another. I have (10+) more in my possession that I haven’t entered into the database.

I have a stack of magazines I haven’t cracked open.

I’m a very aspirational reader. But at some point, I have to make decisions. Or immediately hermitize and just start reading and do nothing else.
