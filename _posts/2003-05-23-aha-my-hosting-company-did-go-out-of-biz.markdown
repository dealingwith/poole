but they've <a href="http://featureprice.atlantic.net/">been bought</a>. here's hoping nothing goes heywire in the switchover and my prices don't increase.



<em>Update:</em> <a href="http://www.thewhir.com/marketwatch/fea050903.cfm">Here's a reliable source</a> on what happened. I'm a little behind on the drama! Apparently the owner has lost his mind a little bit. I was getting wind of some troubles, but with the move and the funeral I didn't have time to worry about it. Besides my email being very slow to connect and apparently bouncing a lot of emails (not a bad thing in the spam-control deptartment anyway), I haven't had a problem except for about 3 days of downtime about a month ago.



Also it does look like my prices will increase.



<em>Update II:</em> Oh well now the sites are down. Isn't that special....of course if you can read this then the problem has been fixed one way or another...
