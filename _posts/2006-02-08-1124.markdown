**One Become Two** The consequences of my behavior Have made me look hard to
find a savior But this train ain't bound for glory It's only a local bound for
Brooklyn

Now that your gone the hardest part is going on And saying goodbye is not as
sad as saying we tried We did all we could do, yeah we did all we could do One
becomes two, and one becomes two

I'm as lost as a boy can be In a city of grids and numbered streets Now I'm
turning a corner I can't be lonely the landmarks all know me

We said the wrong things, at the wrong times We covered the old ground across
the new lines Leaving behind a life once entwined With you, one becomes two

The statues sleep in Central Park The sidewalks talk after dark Me, I count
the change we've saved up for so long To get out this town

...

I don't know what I was talking about when I said the first 3 tracks on Josh
Joplin's new record weren't good. Tracks 2 and 3 are the most brilliant ever.

[I'll post this mp3 when I get home][1].
