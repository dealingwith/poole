[At New York Kennedy airport today, an individual later discovered to be a
public school teacher][1], was arrested trying to board a flight while in
possession of a ruler, a protractor, a setsquare, a slide rule and a
calculator.

Attorney general John Ashcroft believes the man is a member of the notorious
al-gebra movement. He is being charged with carrying weapons of math
instruction.

"Al-gebra is a very fearsome cult, indeed", Ashcroft said. "They desire
average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on a tangent in
a search of absolute value. They consist of quite shadowy figures, with names
like "x" and "y", and, although they are frequently referred to as "unknowns",
we know they really belong to a common denominator and are part of the axis of
medieval with coordinates in every country.

As the great Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, "There are 3 sides to
every triangle."

When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, "If God had wanted
us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more
fingers and toes. "
