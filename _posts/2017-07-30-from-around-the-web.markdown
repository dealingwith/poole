[The Hard Thing About Software Development](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hard-thing-software-development-jesse-watson)

> The greatest misconception about software development is that it is a separable discipline from deep analysis of the business problem. We think all we need is an analyst who understands the business problem, a developer who knows how to code, then they can email a few notes or a specification. "Good to go", right?

> Not so much. At the outset, a business problem might appear simple, or only somewhat complex. You might think you have a handle on all the caveats and corner cases. But the average person who hasn't programmed extensively doesn't appreciate the level of detail and explicitness that computers require to do absolutely anything. Every behavior must be dictated with excruciating specificity. And your plan for how users will interact with the system will likely get thrown out and redrawn from scratch dozens of times before you have a minimum viable product.

> No matter how good you believe you are at envisioning the details, or how sound you believe your logic is, when things get complex, you'll find yourself quickly humbled by the users keeping you honest about what they want, and the computer keeping you honest about the cost of developing it. You'll find out you don't understand the business logic "at depth" until you've tried building an application to solve it.
