> Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume Breathes a life of gathering gloom;
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying, Sealed in the stone cold tomb. [#][3]

My friend and colleague [Wood Ingham][4] wrote the [most amazing Christmas
poem][5], one of the best things I've read all year, something I've read over
and over, and something that has sent me down giant rabbit holes the likes of
which I have not experienced in probably two years (and inspired [this
tweet][6]). Seriously, [go read it][7].

For music: [We Three Kings of Orient Are][8] by Sufjan Stevens.
