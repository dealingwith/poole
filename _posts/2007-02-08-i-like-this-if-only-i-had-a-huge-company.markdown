[Creating Passionate Users: Don't ask employees to be passionate about the
company!][1]:

> Passion for our employer, manager, current job? Irrelevant. Passion for our
profession and the kind of work we do? Crucial. If I own company FOO, I don't
need employees with a passion for FOO. I want those with a passion for the
work they're doing. The company should behave just like a good user interface
-- support people in doing what they're trying to do, and stay the hell out of
their way. Applying the employer-as-UI model, the best company is one in which
the employees are so engaged in their work that the company fades into the
background.

Given a choice, I would work ONLY on projects that followed the Hollywood
Model, where people come together with their respective skills and talents,
and DO something.
