<blockquote>Music and therapy are very similar because both are about the personal development. It is about going further, deeper and having your own cognition and feeling but taking it a step up. It is unravelling mystery and a good song is not written, it is discovered, if you know what I mean.<p align="right">(Eirik Glambek Boe, "who reads psychoanalyst Carl Jung's writings for work and semiotician Umberto Eco's essays for fun")

 It's another rainy day in the lone star state, listening to Kings of Convienence. This record</a> took me longer to warm up to than their last, but now it's my record de jur. You want downloads? <a href="http://www.kingsofconvenience.org/kocdownloads.html">Thems got downloads</a>. Ug: they <a href="http://www.kingsofconvenience.org/05.html">played IOTA last night (would've been a good excuse for a trip to Arlington)...but hey: they're also playing SXSW</a>. Check out <a href="http://www.kingsofconvenience.org/roma052001/08.GloryBox.MP3">their Portishead cover</a>.
