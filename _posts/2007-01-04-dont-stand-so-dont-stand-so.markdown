[Police Reunion Rumors Reaching Fever Pitch][1]

> "One of the times when they were working on the box set or something like
that, they convened the three of us on the phone. Sting and Andy were in
Italy; Andy was visiting Sting at the time, and I was on a DSL line in L.A.,"
he recalled. "And we went down all the song titles from all of our albums.
Song title: 'Can't Stand Losing You.' And we each just talked about the track
and argued and shouted and screamed. There was laughter and tears. It was very
cathartic. It was almost like a therapy session. It was hysterical. It was so
much fun."

"We were really going at it with all the language, straight for the jugular,
refighting the battles, laughing hysterically while we put the stiletto
exactly where we stuck it last time," he continued. "The engineer said it was
like watching a concert. They were in Italy and it's like after dinner, and
I'm here in L.A. at 10 in the morning. I'm getting more and more caffeinated
as they're getting drunker and drunker."
