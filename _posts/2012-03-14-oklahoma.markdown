Took a short family trip to Oklahoma. I flew Carissa's brother Tyler down from Michigan, rented a van and took the five of us and two dogs to the country. Lucy met some extended family for the first time, Penn experienced the thrill of riding in the Polaris Ranger (time and time again), the dogs the thrill (and eventual agony) of running *behind* the Ranger (I would have to contain them on the patio to keep them from running *far* beyond what their little legs could handle). I had big plans for studying my iOS book and finishing [the book I'm currently reading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Rider:_Travels_on_the_Healing_Road) but as always I over-estimated the amount of free time I would experience during a family vacation (although I did get to read quite a bit in the evenings and early mornings). In the end the trip might have been a day too short but that is always preferable to a day too long.
