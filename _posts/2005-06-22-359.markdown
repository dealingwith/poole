Ok this is just too precious to not blog.


I've [already said some of my peace about myspace][1]. But even since then
I've come to truly abhor myspace. Every time a new band informed me of their
new presence on myspace, or worse yet, a band I was interested in had it's
only web presence on myspace, I would fighteningly click the link, flinching
with each additional click within that sick, disturbing world, exiting as soon
as humanly possible. It recently got to the point where I hoped to never need
to visit myspace again.


Well today I was informed that profile information *I had never entered into
my profile* had meen *magically entered in for me, and was being displayed on
my page*. I *know* a lot of people create *false personas* for themselves (on
and offline)

{...ran out of time to finish this rant...}

...some of [my closing comments for myspace][2] (warning...it's not pretty!)
