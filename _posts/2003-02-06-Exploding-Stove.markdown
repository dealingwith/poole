<a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/">kungfugrippe</a> has a new look and Merlin launched <a href="http://www.explodingstove.com/">explodingstove</a> as <em>the new refrigerator for to which I will magnet most of my fingerpainting about web stuff, content management, project management, and Macs...</em> Why it was necessary I don't know, but it was good of him to try out all the OS PHP CMS's for me before I had to. But he was right when he said <em>one of the biggest factors that keeps a lot of people I know from using open source portal sites at all is that they all look like "one of those sites."</em> in <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/archives/2003/01/28/index.php#001972">this important post</a> where he also says <em>I doubt I'm alone in thinking MT has really raised the bar for what non-nerds expect from content management, and I'd be interested to hear what others think--especially writers, non-developing designers, and other non-nerds.</em> <b>Which is exactly where I'm coming from</b> with SWM...I want a very simple, easy to implement CMS for creative people. So far I'm still having to either build it myself or figure some plug-in for some existing app...*sigh*...{aside: I am about to do a major MT deployment for one of the sites I do pro-bono, for my own information and because it will fit their CM needs; but overall I think MT is headed down the wrong path with the piles of needless blogdom features and not creating a solid CM platform, as they easily could.}
