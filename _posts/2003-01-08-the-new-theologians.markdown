I just finished reading Dan Hughes' <i>authority, identity, and the other kingdom</i>. You can maybe get a copy by 1. asking <a href="http://www.theyblinked.com/blog/">him</a>, 2. getting on his <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/theotherkingdom/">yahoo group</a> (altho it is maybe invite only), or 3. buying the <a href="http://www.theooze.com/soularize/resources.cfm">CD from ooze</a> which should contain the talk (ooo I don't see it mentioned there, that is a problem!) for which this document was the notes.

Out of this comes such abortions as 2-week discipleship classes or the monstrosities of systemized small groups that are declared to be community...



"The Kingdom is a movement of revolution that is enacted; of passion that is a total reordering of life along a logic of transformative human encounters that create sacred space in which the impossible is embodied. There is no labyrinth of ideologically correct doctrine; no priviledged interpretive stance. <b>There is the compelling and the less than compelling.</b>"</div>



I'm quite sure if this man puts forth any formal publication of his thoughts on this matter, it will by far excel all.
