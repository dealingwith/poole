[Jordon Cooper: The Cult of Cool][1]:

> Somehow I think we think that cool technology equates with cutting edge
culture and this comes from a weird understanding of culture.

Culture and coolness is local. It’s all local. When I am in rural
Saskatchewan, a leather John Deere ball cap is cool and a very important part
of culture. Yet when I hear people in the church talk about culture, we talk
about “emerging culture” (there is no such thing), or global culture (sorry,
culture is awfully localized). The thinking is what is cool in San Francisco
or New York is going to be cool in Saskatoon or Calgary is incorrect. I always
cringe when I read my blog as being listed as an important blog to read for
understanding culture. That is totally incorrect, you don’t understand culture
by reading a blog about culture...

I'm working on the third installment of my _Antipocalypse_ series for
_Movement_ magazine. The first two can be found [at the writing section of my
website][2]. The first two are fictional. The third is not; it is a
description of what I was shooting at with the first two, "Documentation." It
comes closer to some conclusions on the subject:

> About half my clinical obsession with web technologies is driven by an ADD-
fueled love of all things new and shiny. The other half comes from a
fascination with how the technology allows a boolean-packet level
quantification of not new behaviors, but ways-of-being that predate history.

...The technologies we employ to facilitate these social transactions, they so
often seem to be built with the intention of removing deceit, but...

I'm still working on what comes after that but...I just re-worked something
from [a semi-recent blog entry][3]:

> The tools communicating meaning have replaced actual meaningfulness. And
without actual meaningfulness we lose context. And without context we become
vapid. We become an un-unified theory of everything...we will continue to make
attempts at tools that will give agency to what essentially amounts to some
[vaguely aesthetic abstraction of our desires][4].

All this on the day I'm missing [startupcamp][5] in Austin. I'm in a forced
get-what-you-can-get-done-while-you-can-do-it mode, which today has been this
(writing work), flexing the vocal chords a little (haven't played guitar or
sang hardly at all in months) and thinking about the next record (back in the
studio in 5 weeks), and now...work stuff, because this week was > 50% fail in
that department.
