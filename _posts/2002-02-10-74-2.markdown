Below are a bunch of links I found this morning. They are in no particular
order or organization. They are all very cool and worth a look.


It turns out the idea for a piece of software I had is already being done. See
anything about Storyspace or Eastgate below. So... Whether or not it is being
done WELL is another story. Ahem. Anyway, I have the demo installed on my
machine and maybe I'll use it to model my own custom application that I'll
distribute as shareware. We'll see. At least I know for sure there is a market
for it! And academic circles for the types of things I'm interested in.
