Well, it took most of the day, but I installed MT on my machine and it works. I hope. I had installed PERL on my machine a LONG time ago, when I first meant to go through this exercise, but I still had to install MySQL, which took an hour to download off the Web last night. Now I've messed about with the templates a tad, and I'm going to see how my current SWIM parser likes this RSS 1.0 formatted file.
