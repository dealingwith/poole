<blockquote> I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy

But I can't stop listening to the sound

Of two soft voices mended in perfection

From the reels of this record that I found

Everyday there's a boy in the mirror

Asking me what are you doing here

Finding all my previous motives

Growing increasingly unclear



I've travelled far and I've burned all the bridges

I believed as soon as I hit land

All the other options held before me

Will wither in the light of my plan

So I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy

But there's only one thing on my mind

Searching boxes underneath the counter

On a chance that on a tape I'd find

A song for

Someone who needs somewhere

To long for



Homesick

Cause I no longer know

What home is</blockquote>

Kings of Convenience, <a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/lyric.php?lid=3530822107858508975">Homesick</a>. Mar 20 at the Tea Room oh yeah.



I've added <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/view/dealingwith">my <s>43</s> 24 things</a> to the sidebar (if you're looking at the homepage and not a permalink). I need dependencies. I'm working on a SWIM project management module (in my head, have to finish the initial release first) that I'll be implementing, possibly in public, once it's at least halfway done.
