> News Flash, launch date set for January 26, 2005! Glory

The cross will be over You personally! The Cross will be over every Nation on
earth! Over Afghanistan! Saudi Arabia! Jerusalem! America! The cross in Space
Satellite will be in a Polar orbit from pole to pole. As the earth turns it
will pass over every inch of the earth like peeling an apple. The cross will
circle the earth every one and a half hours. After launch we can tell you on
our site when it will be over you and your nation. We have carried the cross
in Every nation. Now we will, God willing have it flying above Every nation!
We wave the cross in the face of Satan and proclaim that Jesus is Lord over
All the Earth. All glory to God.

Historic launch of the First Cross in Orbit Around the Earth! Also: "The Holy
Bible in Space"
