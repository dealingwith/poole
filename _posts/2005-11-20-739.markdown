_Your absolute must-have requirements mixed in with the shortcomings you're
willing to tolerate will determine what's right for you. (Coincidentally, this
is true of jobs, relationships, locations, houses, and cars, too.)

...How will you use it? Will it fit into your life? Be honest. Don’t let the
features dictate how you use the tool, let your needs dictate what features
you require.

Choose the simple tools that make sense for you...

Don’t get stuck in continual evaluation analysis paralysis, hopping from one
solution or software package to another, relentlessly re-working your process
for the sake of finding the perfect system. Don’t let Shiny New Thing seduce
you. Stick to what works.

...Employ tools that make mundane tasks satisfying and fulfilling - like
dropping those blocks into the right slots in Tetris or popping bubble wrap -
except this game is fitting blocks of information in your life together each
day. Tools we love are tools we use._
