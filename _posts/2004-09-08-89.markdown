> I don't really mind his absence anymore. I don't think of him when I rise
up, and when I lie down. There isn't much he did that I cannot do for myself.
That life, which resonates of him, is not the same life as this one, here,
now; there is so little intersection that there is no point at which I might
be reminded. But sometimes I'll do somethin, and wonder why I've done it:
reach for a thing, want for some specific touch, buy a certain bread or lay a
towel in just that way. And that, I puzzle out, is him. Those little things
he's left behind, those absences of reasons. Those things I must answer with
"because I knew him," not "because I want to" or "because it is the best way."
I've removed his picture from the frame, but I still only sleep on my side of
the bed.


I'm feeling it on all but the side of the bed thing...when I have the bed to
myself I take up the WHOLE THING BABY.


but it's still better to share it... :)
