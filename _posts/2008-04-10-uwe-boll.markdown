[Uwe Boll (Wikipedia)][1]:

> Boll is able to acquire funding thanks to German tax laws that reward
investments in film. The law allows investors in German-owned films to write
off 100% of their investment as a tax deduction; it also allows them to invest
borrowed money and write off any fees associated with the loan. The investor
is then only required to pay taxes on the profits made by the movie; if the
movie loses money, the investor gets a tax writeoff.

...

> We, the undersigned, respectfully ask that Uwe Boll give proper weight to
the wishes of the video game community, the horror community, and the film
going community in general and stop directing, producing, or taking any part
in the creation of feature films. His distasteful handling of the subject
matter and lack of acknowledgement of his failures simply [cannot be abided
any longer][2].

[Uwe Boll responds to petition (YouTube) (NSFW audio)][3]

You'll notice from the wikipedia entry that he also has a doctorate in
literature. I'm always fascinated by conflicts in public narratives--perhaps
more so because they always exist. I have never seen any of his movies before;
I might have to indulge in order to figure out if there is genius or just
wankery going on here. [via epicfu][4]
