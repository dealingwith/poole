[small ritual: moscow][1]:

> moscow is perhaps the most disturbing and fascinating place i've ever been.
how to describe it? a grey, brutal concrete environment, decaying and polluted
- such is the legacy of communism - ruthlessly defaced by hypercapitalist neon
and giant billboards. science fiction is the obvious reference point - blade
runner without the design restraint. plasma screens pump out insane imagery,
billboards cover entire buildings. to speak of 'bad taste' implies that some
notion of good taste is available. the colours and shapes of the neon, the
randomized ahistorical mishmash of the architecture are simply from another
planet. the cyrillic alphabet, similar yet unreadable, adds to the science
fiction effect. it feels as if it were a parallel future - or a foretaste of
the real future for us all in an ecologically wrecked world.

the shock is moral as well as aesthetic. i'm not about to defend soviet
communism, but somewhere in there was an ideal about equality and a society
not based on consumption. and in moscow consumerism has raped the corpse of
that ideal and sits gloating upon it...
