> "Don't get me wrong, LIVE 8 was an amazing media feat. Yes, it may be an
inflection point, from cable to the net, from MTV to remix your own. That,
itself, is a victory for consumers. But isn't there a certain irony for
celebrating a victory for more consumer choice and control for a handful --
around an event on global poverty? Is the highpoint of net-enabled media a
mass entertainment event that draws us to SMS or click on a petition and feel
we have done our part? "
