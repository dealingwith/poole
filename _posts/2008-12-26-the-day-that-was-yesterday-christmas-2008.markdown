[Things that were stuck all over my chest][3]

It's still too soon for me to go into detail about what happened prior to the
paramedics arriving--suffice it to say it was really scary...I'm still dealing
with that part--but, [yes][5], about 8:30 on Christmas morning 2008, I placed
a 911 call; less than 5 minutes later the paramedics arrived.


[I tweeted throughout the hospital stay][6], and called immediate family.
Penn's dad came to the hospital to pick him up and kept him while Carissa
mostly slept and I mostly waited and prayed. All told, we were at the hospital
about 6 hours. The neurologist's diagnosis was that it was likely [Synope][7],
with some inexplicable symptoms during, and we were happy to take an
optimistic diagnosis. The ER doc still wanted to admit her, but she decided to
go home and so we did, by way of Burger King and picking up Penn, who
immediately tore into all of Santa's presents, the opening of which had been
entirely interrupted.


At home the anti-nausea medicine they gave her was still making her really
sleepy, so she slept some more on the couch and the kid (who really had no
mechanisms with which to deal with the entire situation) and I tried to
quietly pass the time. Eventually I think she woke up and put the child to bed
after I had fallen asleep on the floor, then we went to bed very early.


Today she has been a terrible patient, insisting on doing all her normal
activities and refusing all help, so I have had to watch her like a hawk. No
matter the diagnosis of whatever it was that happened yesterday, there is not
much to do other than to hope that it never happens again.

[Carissa blogged about it here][8].
