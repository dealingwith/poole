[My printer, my social letterbox][1]

> If my desktop printer understood the lessons of social software and Web 2.0,
it wouldn’t be attached just to my computer or local network. It’d be
accessible by my closest family and friends, too, regardless of where they
lived. These people are my primary network, the folks for whom I’d put my neck
on the line, and of course I’d let them use my paper and toner, just as I’d
happily leave them with my house keys.

But what would this remote printing be used for?

My family would print me photos–currently the 3 of us have a shared folder
just for pictures, because it’s easy to use and totally private, but an image
landing in a folder doesn’t mirror its social importance to me.

My mum, instead of scanning newspaper clippings and emailing them to me
(happily, her scanner has a single button that does that whole job), she would
print them straight into my house.

My close friends would send me sketches, or print out long articles that I
really must read. Yes, we can do this by email–but everyone in the world can
send me articles by email. I have a much closer relationship with these
people, so why doesn’t my computer support that?

It’s the desktop printer meets social software meets the fax machine, but in
everyday life rather than the office. The printer is no longer a printer, it’s
my social letterbox.
