_A CEO with hotel chain A found himself having to spend a night in a hotel
from hotel chain B. Naturally, he was very curious as to what kind of
information systems they had, and resolved to keep an open eye for competitive
use of IT. As he approached the reception for first time, the woman behind it
smiled at him and said "Welcome back, Sir!"

Flabbergasted, he said "But...it is 12 years since I was here last! How could
you know that I have stayed here before, what kind of advanced information
systems do you have that can store and find the fact that I was here 12 years
ago?"

"Well, it is really very simple", she said. "When the doorman opened the door
to your cab, he asked if this was your first stay with us. You answered no,
and as you walked through the door, the doorman looked at me through the
window and touched his nose. That told me that you should be welcomed
back...."_
