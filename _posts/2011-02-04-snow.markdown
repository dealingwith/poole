Most of you are living it as well, but after four snow days in a row, having gotten out once since Monday (and Monday I went on a mountain bike ride in regular shorts and jersey) and then only to get [my tire fixed](http://twitpic.com/3w60vp) and re-stock on milk and beer...well, I'm over it. I am normally a fan of colder weather but the bike being a rare refuge of late, Texans in general--and specifically civically--unprepared for such conditions and 7-year-olds being particularly prone to the more annoying strains of cabin fever have all taken their toll.

Last night when the snow started to fall about midnight I kind of resigned to it all. And today our good friend and neighbor Brix had another one of his famous impromptu front porch fetes. Standing by a fire with a beer and a cigar as big flakes continued to fall throughout the afternoon, it wasn't so bad. The sun even came out. For about 15 minutes.

Ringo, of course, **loves** it. He's the Kenneth Parcell of our family.

<p class="postscript">I miss her so much. I couldn't stop thinking about how much she would have loved the snow. How much better all this time stuck inside would have been, stuck inside with her.</p>
