[GodTube Raises $30m for Jesus 2.0 Â© - ReadWriteWeb][1]:

> All content, right down to the comments, is vetted by human editors before
it appears on GodTube. That labor requirement, in addition to the prevalence
of 30 minute long videos, is sure to eat up a large amount of cash.
Fortunately for GodTube there's advertising revenue to be made from the only
other nearly-omniscient party on the company's radar - Google. The Money

The investment comes from a company called GLG Global Investment Management,
whose website greats US visitors with a statement explaining that the site is
not intended for US audiences and that due to regulatory requirements US
residents should leave. Presumably the GodTube founders chose to stay on the
site. The London based company is a hedge fund that specializes in trading the
debts of "emerging markets" (Third World countries). Charming folks.
