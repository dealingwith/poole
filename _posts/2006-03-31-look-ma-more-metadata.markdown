you know, you'd think if you were going to roll out new stuff for 9,900,000
users, you'd be a little pickier about the details. with tags, they didn't
line up the display with the other metadata, making the metadata section of a
post all jagged (and they still don't even remember/display your already-used
tags on an new entry page). now with location, they don't capitalize the
label, and they just make it a link to googlemaps, as opposed to making it
something useful against my data, like displaying all entries created at that
location.

oh lj how we love u so for your imperfection...
