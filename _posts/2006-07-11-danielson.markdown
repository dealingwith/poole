this is how i feel today: [![][1]Danielson - Did I Step On Your Trumpet?][2]

[![buy SHIPS on amazon][3]][4]in other news, last saturday i spent two hours
in line to see [danielson][5]. it was worth it thanks to sir smith, but i'll
never go to rubbergloves in denton again. i sure hope they play someplace
better next time. what a clusterfuckshithole.

[![has anyone ever stepped on a trumpet?][6]][7]i was going to apologize for
not posting any mp3's, but hark, [there are lots on the ol' website][8], [and
the other ol' website][9]. download away!

[get the latest - ships - on amazon][10]
