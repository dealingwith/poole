  * Guinness

  * Seeing Kausar and Farah and getting to share a bit in their new life here

  * The kind of proper European pedestrian-only downtown thing

  * Getting bikes out of storage and then riding them back through the Irish
countryside

  * Just more perfect weather

  * Irish accents

  * Taking a lot more pictures, i.e. getting the annoying photographer thing
back again, which is a mixed bag. Also, my OCD data-head side wants pictoral
evidence to be proportional to the experiential, which is impossible. So half
of my pictures from the trip will be from my 2 days in Ireland, and half those
will be from a few hours in a pub. Actually, I guess that's appropriate.

Been a good trip, it has.
