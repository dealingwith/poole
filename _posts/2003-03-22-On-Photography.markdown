01. On photography: I was taking pictures in the Pennsylvania countryside today and had these thoughts:



01a. My approach to photography is actually backwards: my first concern is the subject, then the framing, then the light (I don't even know more technical details than just light). Sometimes there isn't enough light, or not the right angle, and I will try for a while; but I still shoot the thing because it interested me.



01b. My joy and hope in photography is to notice something that the rest of humanity is passing by (these types of photos are also the ones that I enjoy the most). All day we go about our business, passing hundreds or thousands of objects and people of great beauty. To actually stop, notice, and record that beauty is an act of great meaning.
