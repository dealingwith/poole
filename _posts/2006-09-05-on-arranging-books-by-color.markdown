[Design Observer: writings about design & culture: On Arranging Books by
Color][1]

> Another of Luke's reasons is this: organizing his books by color allows him
to discover new and unexpected relationships between books he knows well
already. When two unrelated books are forced to occupy the same shelf simply
because of their spine color, the shelver is asked to think about whether they
have ideas to share between them. Perhaps, the designers of these
chromatically-related books saw something in the books' content that even
their authors did not. Maybe their ideals share a common hue?
