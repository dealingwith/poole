hey i'm a schmo for not seeing this earlier, but it's made an otherwise dark day a little better: scott's <a href="http://www.gravattville.com/aboutme.jpg">about</a> page uses a picture i took and a card i wrote. the front of the card can be found on his homepage/blog <a href="http://www.gravattville.com/2002_08_01_blogarchives.html#80318108">here</a>.
