I haven't been this drunk in a long, long time. A little too much
tonight...I've got an ice pack to my head trying to not get sick, but I know
success in that only means a bigger hangover in the morning.

It was the free shot in the middle of all the beer that did me in.

Please someone make the world stop spinning.

Bah.
