![][1]"The world's first cloned kitten, CC, was born Dec. 22, 2001, at the
College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M University. The announcement of the
first successful cat cloning was delayed until the animal had completed its
shot series and its immune system was fully developed.

"Genetic Savings & Clone, a Sausalito, Calif.-based firm has led the way in
commercial cat-cloning, generating more buzz per manufactured unit than any
company on earthâ€”so far it has cloned two beloved tabbies for customers at
$50,000 a piece." [#][2]
