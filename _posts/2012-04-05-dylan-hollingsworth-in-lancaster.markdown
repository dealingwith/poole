[Aftermath](http://www.dylanhollingsworth.com/Blog/post/2012/04/05/Aftermath.aspx):

> I ended up visiting a neighborhood in Lancaster that got pretty torn up and walked through the neighborhood shooting and helping people where i could. The general consensus of those i spoke with was one of gratitude to be alive and that most of what was lost was replaceable. It is sobering and makes me realize that the good and bad things that shape my life are on their way. I don't get to choose what day they get here. They are just coming. 

I often ride my bike through this area that was hit by one of the tornados that rolled through DFW on Tuesday. My friend Dylan chased the tornados and his thoughts afterwards resonated with me.
