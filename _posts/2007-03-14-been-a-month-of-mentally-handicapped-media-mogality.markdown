The reason I don't get SO up in arms (like I did yesterday) about when [TV and
film industry blowhards do the suing for free publicity thing][1] is because
Google feels like the really big alpha dog that's going to protect our tribe
from danger. Google needs to get into the online music delivery business. The
benevolent dictator thing with Google came up last night. I heart Goog so
much.

(...like, "If I had known that being a jerk to fans made that kind of money, I
would have spit on each and every one of you." and "And although 'drunk
falling down the stairs' is normally attributed to Ted Kennedy, he nor Viacom
actually own the rights.")
