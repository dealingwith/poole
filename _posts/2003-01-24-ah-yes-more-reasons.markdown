It's no secret that I do not call myself a Christian {even though I have what I would consider an (increasingly quirky) ...grr, no other words coming to mind... <em>relationship</em> ...there, i said it. crap... with g-o-d, and of course am still totally facinated with Jesus (and I'm <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101030127-409570,00.html">not alone</a>, as I find through <a href="http://www.theyblinked.com/blog/">TBd</a>)}.



But still, every once and while, the ongoing series "...if we needed more reasons" rears its ugly head, and this is one of those moments:



<a href="http://www.lifeway.com/lwc/">lifeway</a> (via <a href="http://ftrain.com">ftrain</a> links of all people {can't find his links on the web anymore, good thing i subscribed to the <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/xml/rdf/links.rss">xml feed</a> when i did})



and Terry Clan, posting comments to <a href="http://www.jordoncooper.sk.ca/2003_01_01_archives.html#90224572">this post by Jordon</a>



Both of these exist together in, personify even, western Christendom. These could be the same person. Lifeway could be Terry's favorite site on the Web. 



Any questions?
