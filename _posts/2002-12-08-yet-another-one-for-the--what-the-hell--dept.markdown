<i>so, i went to a musical today. at a church. sar and ayesh were in it. they did great. nonetheless, i walked away dumbfounded at the theme. it was a Christmas musical... with a military theme. "what the hell?" i thought to myself. how does that not seem totally skewed to other people??? "am i really the only adult here that this seems wack to?" i thought to myself. anyway, after 25 minutes of as many battle songs and children in fatigues that they could cram into the service the odd juxtaposition of Jesus-in-the-manger and children singing about marching, crushing and winning came to a close.</i>
