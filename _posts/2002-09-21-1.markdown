HEY SO OK. Everything worked out OK. Played acoustic in the small room where <s>my</s> <i>our</i> stuff is (<b>update</b>: <i>still</i>) hanging. Perfect amount of people for that room showed up and we had a great time together. It was very chill, very fun, very loving space. I read some from <a href="ir/micha/">Micha's Story</a>. Sung a lot. Talked too much. Yeah. Thanks everyone who showed. I live because of you.

<a href="miriam/">Miriam</a> especially helped me out today and I just want to tell the world how much I love her. She's awesome!
