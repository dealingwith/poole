> I'm an armadillo. Take it from me that I know what it's like to feel
unwanted in the world. Sometimes I think about just getting drunk and
Froggering my way along the interstate into oblivion. Peter, beneath this
semi-armored exoderm beats an unguarded heart. But I know that those dark days
are just days, you know, and on those days I wake up and say, 'I'm a nocturnal
creature, dammit! If I sleep all day, it's gravy because that is my natural
way! I like the nightlife; I like to boogie.
