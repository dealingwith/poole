I'm violating my promise to only mention more-obscure artists here, but I've already gone back on the quality over quantity thing. A blog has as varied a life as the one who creates it, I guess.



Vertical Horizon is, yes, a more mainstream band, but their new record seems to have missed most people's radar...which is to be expected as it is some of their best work since before they were signed. I assume VH is still paying off label debts at this point, so the sophmore release is critical to their longterm sustainability (although maybe not--they were around a long time before breaking, and so they probably were already sustainable and therefore in a good contractual situation). So hear me out, and if their kind of music is your bag, go get the disc.



The thing about Go is its lyrical maturity, and specifically its relevance to themes in my own life. If Ohio is the anthem cry of one trying to save love, Go is the productive love-goes-on soundtrack (bit of a freudian there--I meant to type life-goes-on).



The song that turned me on to this record, it is apparently on the radio in some limited fashion, is <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/I'm-Still-Here-lyrics-Vertical-Horizon/27D47D21A86B70C848256D8E00130F02">I'm Still Here</a>, although this doesn't really fall into the said category. This is the beginning of the journey, looking back down the road before spinning around the taking the first new steps onward. I was most struck by the last lines:


<blockquote>Remember how you use to say I'd be the one to run away
But I'm still here</blockquote>


...but the second verse and chorus are interesting as well:


<blockquote>You've seen the ashes in my heart
You smile the widest
When I cry inside and my insides blow apart
I tried to wear another face
Just to make you proud
Just to make you put me in my place
But everything you wanted from me
Is everything that I could never be


The cities grow

The rivers flow

Where you are, I never know

But I'm still here

If you were right and I was wrong

Why are you the one who's gone

And I'm still here</blockquote>



Matt Scannell and I seem to have had some similar experiences at least...but the better stuff is yet to come. <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/Goodbye-Again-lyrics-Vertical-Horizon/8E4A8F8C10FBE3A048256D8E0013024B">Goodbye Again</a>:


<blockquote>Guess I don't know what's, left to say
But hear me out
All of the dreams of, yesterday
Keep breaking me down
What's on the outside, can you say
Or am I getting carried away


It's in your mind

It's in your eyes

So it's goodbye again

It's way past time

For one last try

So it's goodbye again

Goodbye... again



I'm getting on, what's the use

You know how I get

I can't decide which is the truth

At least not yet

I got the feeling, it's you

What can be said, alone in this room

No...



<em>chorus</em>



Who wants you now?

Maybe somebody else

I'll wait around

Maybe you'll forget you were ever here

Maybe forget you were ever, never here</blockquote>



<a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/It's-Over-lyrics-Vertical-Horizon/CCCAF101059BF25048256D8E0012FA04">It's Over</a>, another one! This one, though, indicates the kind of idealistic love that artists seem to always aspire to and be crushed by:


<blockquote>I'm here, wide awake again
This fear is something I call a friend
Hello again
It's been a while since I saw you here
I don't remember you saying goodbye


No, It don't matter it's over

Here I've been waiting

All my life

All this time

It don't matter it's over

Here I've been waiting

All my life

All this time



Here we go, jump to the stars above

So low, why do I fall to love?

Hello my love

This voice never called your name

This boy will never be the same</blockquote>



<a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/Echo-lyrics-Vertical-Horizon/E09CB60BD1144C4048256D8E0012FE18">Echo</a> communicates some of the frustration of the artistic life. We are prophets, the only ones left, but so much of what we say is prepackaged into irrelevance and forgotten as soon as it's consumed:


<blockquote>Everything I say fades out


Echo, echo...

We come, we go

No I don't want to be just another

Echo, echo...</blockquote>



The last tune I'm going to mention is <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/Lyric.nsf/Inside-lyrics-Vertical-Horizon/2B54109637D4673648256D8E0012EE1B">Inside You</a>. Right away you think it is a carnal reference, and it probably is, but the song communicates the true intimacy that that experience comes out of, the true, beautiful intimacy that humanity longs for, both with its creator and with other people.


<blockquote>We're all lost
We're all found
We're all the same
Just one heart
Beats in us
With different names
Just one heart
--different names


Hold me, inside you

Cause I wanna be,

Inside you

Inside you</blockquote>



...i changed some of the words to what I hear when i listen to it...
