<a href=" http://radio.weblogs.com/0104487/outlines/aR/activeRenderer.html">active renderer</a> for radio userland. may push me to make the big purchase of radio.



<strong>Update:</strong> Radio is <a href="http://radio.userland.com/faq">licensed on a yearly basis</a>--40 clams a year. Not cool w/me; I'd rather pay more but have it for good. This yearly stuff sounds too much like Time Life Books or a bad car lease.
