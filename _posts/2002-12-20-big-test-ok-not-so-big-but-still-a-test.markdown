I'm implementing little SWM features on the front end because I know how to do it and it's easy 
		(those go hand in hand :). So check out the 'cussin bastard' post about four posts ago, as well as this one, to see 
		the new SWM feature in action.


Anyway, what I really should be doing is working on the back end stuff that makes this closer to a 
		deployable product! Oh well, that too; I just have to learn some stuff first...SO off to read some more (or not--it's Friday :).
