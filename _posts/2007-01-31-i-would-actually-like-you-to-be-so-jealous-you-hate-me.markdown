did a little retail therapy -slash- necessary upgrading this morning:

![][1]

13.3" MacBook Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz White 1GB/80GB/SD with Parallels Desktop
and Microsoft Windows XP Home pre-installed

SO didn't think I was going to switch. But I already feel superior. 3-7 days
shall not come soon enough (went online for no tax and Parallels thrown in).
