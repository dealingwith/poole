_On the anniversary of the great American tax tradition I shall turn thirty-
five, or what I like to think of as not quite half-life but getting there
sooner than later. I'm counting on medical science to cure everything in
another ten years so that as I grow older all I have to worry about is which
dialect of Chinese I need to learn in order to shop for groceries, pay bills,
and play World of Warcraft.

As I turn older I find myself pondering more, playing chess with life's
problems instead of checkers. From what I've witnessed of growing old I'll
continue to refine this "chess game" until I'm sixty when the game switches to
bridge. This is followed by playing Parcheesi around seventy and then a
graceful move to Chutes and Ladders sometime around eighty._
