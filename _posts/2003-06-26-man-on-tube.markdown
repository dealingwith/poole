You know, sometimes I'm ready to just bail on this thinking-feeling-fame-and-fortune thing and just drink myself to death.



You know, I actually said one time that I couldn't understand how spouses could sit around all day and just watch the telly; but now I take that back; but I bet it is even better to sit around all day watching telly and then get completely pissed every night. That sounds like a plan.



I am the pathetic spouse.
