_Web content is hard. Especially if you want really good Web content.

It's harder than mapping out the information architecture. It's harder than
the visual design, development or programming. By hard I mean it takes time,
effort and skill. And lots of it. All three.

It's not all about writing. It's much more than that. It's about writing, and
editing, and knowing what your readers want_
