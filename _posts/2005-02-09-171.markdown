**Your Dominant Intelligence is Linguistic Intelligence**

![][1] You are excellent with words and language. You explain yourself well.
An elegant speaker, you can converse well with anyone on the fly. You are also
good at remembering information and convicing someone of your point of view. A
master of creative phrasing and unique words, you enjoy expanding your
vocabulary.

You would make a fantastic poet, journalist, writer, teacher, lawyer,
politician, or translator.
