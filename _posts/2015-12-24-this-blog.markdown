This blog started in September 2001 after I read a Wired magazine article on Blogger. It's currently in a bit of a state, and I'll be cleaning it up and organizing it over the coming months. But it does contain (almost) every post from these 14 years.

Some stats:

* 3,194 posts:
  * 2001: 45
  * 2002: 467
  * 2003: 568
  * 2004: 216
  * 2005: 406
  * 2006: 456
  * 2007: 300
  * 2008: 373
  * 2009: 115
  * 2010: 63
  * 2011: 94
  * 2012: 37
  * 2013: 21
  * 2014: 23
  * 2015: 10
* 558,481 words
  * an average of 175 words per post
* 4374 links total
  * 1062 dead links
* 4 blogging engines
  * Blogger
  * A homespun PHP blog engine
  * LiveJournal
  * For about 6 years now, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), with a short break to test out the great engine at [Known](http://withknown.com).
* More designs than I could track, although after a quick trip through the Wayback Machine, I am still pretty happy with most of them. Minimalism serves well.
