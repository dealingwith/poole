i just had a religious discussion with a family member that made me a) wish
i'd gone to church this morning and b) play Hallelujah on the guitar

> i heard there was a secret chord that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do you well it goes like this the fourth,
the fifth the minor fall and the major lift the baffled king composing
hallelujah

well, maybe there's a god above but all i've ever learned from love was how to
shoot somebody who outdrew you it's not a cry that you hear at night it's not
somebody who's seen the light it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

and realize that most people don't understand doubt as the strongest form of
faith. probly a lot from [Peter Rollins][1] (of
http://www.paperstreet.org.uk/ikon/) as this all bubbles back up to the
surface...:P
