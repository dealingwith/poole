So I did my first <a href="http://moveabletype.org">MT</a> install yesterday, and realized that a lot of people who don't advertise their RSS feed, but use MT, probably do have them residing on their server. For example, here are two sites I've subscribed to without their advertising their feeds:



<a href="http://www.lt-smash.us/">Lt. Smash</a>: <a href="http://www.lt-smash.us/index.rdf">RSS 1.0</a> <a href="http://www.lt-smash.us/index.xml">RSS 0.91</a>



<a href="http://jeansandatshirt.com/">jeans and a t-shirt</a>: <a href="http://jeansandatshirt.com/index.rdf">RSS 1.0</a> <a href="http://jeansandatshirt.com/index.xml">RSS 0.91</a>



In case you didn't figure it out, if a site doesn't show an RSS feed link, just look for "index.rdf" or "index.xml" depending on which RSS version you would like.
