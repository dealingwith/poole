<s>Figured out that <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/festival/">Greenbelt</a> just isn't going to happen for me this year, for the third year in a row.</s> Two years ago I had a business trip to London <i>that weekend</i>, I got to the UK on Saturday so the only real option was Sunday, and Grnblt isn't exactly close to London, particularly if you have no vehicle and/or know NO one. Last year I'd just been fired from my company, so it wasn't exactly the time to go spending 100's of $'s on flights to the UK. <s>This year the schedule is just too full, and I have the other guys from <a href="http://christianpornmachine.org">CPM</a> coming through town that weekend, on their way to Boston. So I'm fkd. :*(</s>
