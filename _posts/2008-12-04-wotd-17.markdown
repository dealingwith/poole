[Bikeshedding][1]

> It comes from [Parkinson's Law][2] by C. Northcoate Parkinson. He describes
how a planning board will approve spending millions of dollars to build an
atomic power plant but if you go to them to get approval to build a bike shed
they will argue endlessly. The problem being that the atomic power plant is so
large, complex, and difficult to understand that no one can really argue about
how exactly it is done. On the other hand, everyone knows what goes into a
building a bike shed and so everyone feels qualified to argue about the
details.

For some reason, technical discussions seem to be particularly susceptible to
bikeshedding.
