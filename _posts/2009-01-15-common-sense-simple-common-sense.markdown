[From the comments][1]:

> It's interesting how the Windows UI has gotten more bright an colorful as
time has gone on. The OSX User Interface on the other hand, is almost entirely
grey now, save application icons.

If your job required you to listen all day long, would you prefer a system
that was loud all the time, or a system that was quiet all the time, only
making noise when required?

Also:

> I spend my life struggling with "enterprise-class" software UIs. If the
Windows Explorer UI was the worst I ever had to deal with, my professional
life would be practically trouble-free.
