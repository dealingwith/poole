[![/][1]][2]

really having a prob with this lately, and been taking me iron and sleeping a
decent amount. just read my last entry…haven't been getting 9 hours a night
though, more like 6…so maybe i really have to get my shit in gear and get
stuff done during the day so i can sleep at night.

[these are interesting results][3]


[especially the first one][4]
