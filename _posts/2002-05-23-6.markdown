<small>Again, I apologize, this narrative is being presented out of order. We have misplaced some of the sections, and the following is actually from a section further along. <i>-Ed.</i></small>

<font color="#336699">I guess you could say that Rob attracted the same kind of people as porn does; you know, blond, normally kind of low-grade ugly but made beautiful under the airbrush and your lust. People from small towns in the Midwest with big stars in their eyes but never the connections to make it happen. Transplanted people, far from what they were trained/brought up to understand as true reality, grasping at anything to pull them up to their dreams, to pull them out from their hell. Desperate people. Like me.</font>
