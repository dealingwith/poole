title: "Nothing to Write"
---

I want for but have nothing to write  
My art wing is broken and my past full of shame  
For those things I had supposed upon us

<p class="postscript">I started this poem on October 23rd. I have no idea where I was going with it, so I decided to just post it. Clearly I have nothing to write.</p>
