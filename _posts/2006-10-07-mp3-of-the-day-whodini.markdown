[Whodini - The Freaks Come Out At Night][4]

Back in the day, by which I mean elementary school and a portion of jr. high,
I was really into hip hop music. Whodini was possibly my favorite. My ex-
brother-in-law introduced me to them. Last week I was copying some music from
a coworker and saw this...and just about freaked out. It has to have been 18
or so years since I listened to Whodini. Talk about a light-speed trip down
memory lane. It's amazing how music and smells are the two most memory-
inducing senses. Anyway, it was a fun trip and I share these with you now for
your own amusement and perhaps a trip of your own back into the 80's.
