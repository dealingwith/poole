<i>Tech:</i> <b>Syndication Page</b>

This may take a little while to load but I've done something smart with RSS feeds, methinks:

<a href="http://www.danielsjourney.com/syndicates.php">SWiM News Aggregate</a>:

I finally got my new aggregator set up the way I like. Still working on who's in there by default, and this type of page will be a configurable option in the final SWiM product.

Catching you up: the new-new-new name for the blogger on steroids is Simple Widget Mover.
