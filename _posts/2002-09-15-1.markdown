<li>All week: Bosnian 5hrs a day + homework. Practicing like crazy for gig.
<li>Monday: Legends of Rodeo in Richmond
<li>Tuesday: <b>Update</b>: Over the Rhine is NOT this month--they're in <s>NOV</s> OCT (see how my brain is spent)! Actually a good thing. I'm SO busy! :) :P Guitar lesson 6pm.
<li>Thursday: Open mic, Dremo's.

Last week was also Bosnian all week, Monday night I was up till 5 working on design issues. Tuesday I went out to see a friend of mine Samantha (and Mike) play at Whitlows and ended up staying out late talkin' with all kinds of people but mostly John A. Wed I slept 14 hours. Thursday I played Dremo's open mic. Friday we went out with foreign service people to this overly gooch place in the District.

So u see...
