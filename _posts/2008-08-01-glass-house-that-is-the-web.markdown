For a couple days I've wanted to post a follow up to "[At least I'm not the
only failure around here OR Learning from others fail][1]", where I beat up on
[last.fm][2]'s latest redesign. I needed to correct myself on the "why are my
weekly charts (really the only thing I go to the site for) now an extra two
clicks away?" Turns out they are right there on my user page, and in fact do
not require a page refresh to traverse the various charts. Bravo!

I am curious if "last 7 days" means they have changed the way they get that
data, because it used to be "last week", meaning Monday-Sunday. I haven't
looked at it carefully enough to know if it is indeed a nicely updated feature
or a UI copy writing fail.

Which brings me to [delicious][3]' new redesign. I'm not going to be as hasty
--I barely interact with the actual website anyway thanks to their brilliant
Firefox plugin (which, thanks to the new redesign, I can' find the URL
for)--but they violated the one design "thing" (it is so common I hesitate to
call it a mistake) that gets my goat more than almost any other:

See, the web has one serious problem, despite many fine professionals'
attempts to correct it: Typography. And because I can't yet rely on a
particular website to give serifs to only fonts above a certain pixel size or
not use that god-forsaken Arial, and since I have yet to find a browser or
plugin that allows me fine-grained control over such things (even an "allow
*this* site to specify their own fonts" would do for now), I have to set every
font on every web page I visit to Verdana.*

And about 15% of the time, this breaks the layout of some page. Sometimes it
is because the designer of said broken site has been too ambitious. They
wanted their aesthetic cake with accessible icing.

I just didn't expect it to break something as solid as delicious. That's all.
And it does. And whenever this happens, sometimes making my text bigger snaps
things back into place, sometimes making it smaller helps. In this case either
direction fixes/breaks different things.

I like their new tagging-as-address-bar-ish-breadcrummy thing they have going
on now. I like some of the aesthetic choices. I like [how they showed the
differences in that little video on their blog][4]. I just wish I could use
the site w/o letting them shit Arial all over my screen. (Even though
*everyone* uses it.)

And the user icon is a total rip off of PBS!!

* Many, many amazing designers would take great exception to my embrace of
Verdana, and that's fine, and we can have that conversation later** ...But
everyone agrees that Arial is awful. I mean come on!

** For now, let's just point out that it is a font designed by an actual
typographer for the expressed purpose of being displayed on a screen made of
pixels.

Ok, back to my own little world of fail now...
