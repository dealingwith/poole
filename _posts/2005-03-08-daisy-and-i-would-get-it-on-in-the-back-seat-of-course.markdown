> Viacom's Country Music Television channel is running help wanted ads for
this position -- Vice President, CMT Dukes of Hazzard Institute. That's right.
That's what the ads say, noting the pay is $100,000 for the duration of a one-
year contract.

The vice president will have to watch Dukes of Hazzard every weeknight on
Country Music Television, know all the words to The Dukes of Hazzard theme
song and write the Dukes of Hazzard on-line blog for CMT.com, Country Music
Television's Web site.

The person selected will also have to be available for media interviews to
"share his or her expertise and passion" for the TV program and make
appearances at events such as Dukefest 2005 in Bristol, Tenn., in June,
according to the ad.

A valid driver's license is required, the advertisement says, because the
applicant may be required to drive the General Lee, an orange 1969 Dodge
Charger driven by the fictional Bo and Luke Duke in the show, which originally
ran from 1979 to 1985.

The "job application" does not ask about relevant work experience or
educational background.

But it does ask, "If you, Bo, Luke and Daisy took off in the General Lee, what
would happen next?" The character Daisy was Bo and Luke's cousin in the show.
