> "My wife's a swinger."

"Another lyric? A September song? ...Is this a lament for the Judy that once
was or an anthem for all the fun she's having with her new friends? I can see
it now: as the first guitar chords are struck and the lasers kick in, everyone
in the stadium's standing, stomping, clapping and cheering. It's more popular
than 'Like a Rolling Stone.'"

"She'll like that...I don't think I'd want her to like it."

"You can't stop progress...fight city hall...know a woman's heart...the reach
of America's national security agencies or why power trumps love every fucking
time."
