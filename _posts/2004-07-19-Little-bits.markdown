Internet is still flaky at the new place, having to hang at the <a href="http://www.rearviewwindow.com/blog/">Rudds</a> to get stuff done online. A few more tasks and then I'm sequestering myself for a couple weeks anyway. August is going to be a crazy cool month around here, though, so stay tuned.



<a href="http://goforthethroat.blogspot.com/">Emily</a> is back from Bosnia, bringing precious Auras with her, and I think I recognized every single place she photodocumented. Very jealous. Wish Mr. Henderson was going to be there longer, I'll be up for a trip next summer.



The permalink is dead, long live the permalink. I'm <a href="http://akma.disseminary.org/archives/001422.html">referenced in this AKMA post</a>, but he links only to the root of <a href="http://www.the-next-wave.org/">the-next-wave.org</a>, not <a href="http://www.the-next-wave.org/stories/storyReader$328">the actual article I wrote</a>. So now a Google of my name will turn up next-wave. Bah.

He did <a href="http://questfortherest.com/">the Polyphonic Spree flash game</a> that's on their site and the new CD/DVD (which you should go purchase ASAHP).
