[MetaUrchins Book Project][1]


Creating a book from an ARG. Similar to what I proposed [here][2].


[The online book][3] requires the Flash plugin. Will have to look at that
later.


Check out their very readable [About Us (and then some)][4].

> This website was formed as a hub for the creation of a book chronicling the
recently concluded "MetaCortex" [Alternate Reality Game][5] (ARG).
"MetaUrchins" is just a name we came up with to identify the many players of
the ARG. As you may have already seen, the book is still a work in progress,
and we're always adding to and changing it. Once we finish it and decide it's
ready, we may publish it through [CafePress Publishing][6].

> In the summer of 2003, a fascinating socio-zoological development in the
MetaUrchin sub-civilization occurred. Hearing a beacon call previously known
only to birds preparing to migrate for the winter (or perhaps demonstrating
characteristics commonly found in another red-eyed, furry creature, the
lemming), hundreds of MetaUrchins began congregating around the vicinity of
[Unfiction][7], a formerly pristine and untouched wilderness of the internet,
whose ecosystem soon buckled under the weight and pure bandwidth-consuming
power of these resource-sucking byte monkeys.


In numbers far too great to be tabulated by any hit counter, they came. No
cyberscape was left unsullied, no stone was left unturned, no Flash was left
undecompiled. And what was the clarion call that beckoned these fair travelers
to their voracious feedings? Sustenance? Wealth? Manifest Destiny? No. They
came to play an Alternate Reality Game.
