![][1]Updated the header graphic on [my main site][2]. Still making my mind up
about it, but the old one was from September; it hadn't felt that long in the
tooth yet, but now I know why I wanted to change it up! Because of [IE][3]'s
bad handling of margins, the graphic is up too far and loses some of its
detail.

![][4][I'm playing this Friday in a coffeeshop][5], let's say 9-11pm. It will
be a casual affair but if you are in the area and in the mood to be serenaded,
do show!
