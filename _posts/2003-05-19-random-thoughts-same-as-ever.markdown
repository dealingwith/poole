I want to write something useful/purposeful, but all the work I have to do for books or projects involves editing and deep thinking, and it's still morning.



I had the stupid/profound thought today that life here is really going to be very similar to how it was in DC or even FL. I will spend much of my time at my computer/desk. I will read and learn more through new media than I care to, exist within this environment known loosely as the Web, really just an expanded community/space. I will run errands, clean, hopefully cook better, muse, hopefully go play music. I will hopefully do all those things I wrote about the other day.



Not much different except I live in a beautiful apartment in a beautiful city in a beautiful part of the world...and I have to use more hand signals communicating on those errands.
