The other night over beer and pizza after Helvetica i was explaining to how
given the brain i have been given*, it is very difficult to learn a new
language but once learned, [i get off on this kinda stuff][1]**.

* adept at connecting the pieces, but not so at memorizing what those pieces
are in the first place.

** i should have written this as a garden path sentence, but honestly i'm
taking a short mental break and haven't the time to work it out
