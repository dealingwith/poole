[#][1] nerds are often disorganized or have a twisted skein of attention-
deficit issues # nerds love assessing, classifying, and defining the objects
in their world # nerds crave actionable items and roll their eyes at 'mission
statements' and lofty management patois # nerds like things that work with
technology-agnostic and lofi tools # nerds like frameworks but tend to ignore
rules # nerds are unusually open to change (if it can be demonstrated to work
better than what they're currently using) # nerds like fixing things on their
own terms # nerds have too many projects and lots and lots of stuff
