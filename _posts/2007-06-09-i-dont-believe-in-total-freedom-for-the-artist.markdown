> I don't believe in total freedom for the artist. Left on his own, free to do
anything he likes, the artist ends up doing nothing at all. If there's one
thing that's dangerous for an artist, it's precisely this question of total
freedom, waiting for inspiration and all the rest of it.

- Federico Fellini [#][1]
