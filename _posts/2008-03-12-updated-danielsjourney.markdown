Originally uploaded by [dealingwith][4]

I updated [danielsjourney.com][5]. I had sort-of taken the site down for a
couple weeks out of external frustrations, and played with a bunch of options
for how I might re-vamp the site, but in the end the underlying markup hasn't
changed that much, nor has the way the content is presented (although that is
what I wasn't exactly happy with with the last design). It is even more
lightweight than it was, the markup only has two structural elements and the
CSS is now _really_ small. I was/am still thinking about adding content from
all the different areas not represented (Flickr, Vimeo, etc), as well as
adding customization options, but in the end have kept just the LJ, Delicious,
and Twitter for now.


I also updated /writings and /art quite a bit. There is still quite a bit of
archived stuff to add to those areas, but I got a good chunk re-published.
Turned out a lot of the art stuff was still on the server, just either not
linked to properly or still the victim of a Dreamhost server hack that
occurred last summer.

Welcome feedback.

mp3s of the day: [David Sedaris, Parade][6] (part), which I just found
hilariously appropriate on many levels. [Sean Lennon, Two Fine Lovers][7],
which I'm just really into at the moment.
