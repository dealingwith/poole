And once I am able to wrestle said blog's data out of its **_RDF store_** (for
*&#$ sake) and put it into a normal database I will be able to show you.

But in the meantime I wrote this in an email just now and thought it
preservation-worthy:

My relationship with the Semantic Web (big S big W) parallel paths my
relationship with Religion (big R)...I still have faith, but when it comes to
the religious doctrines of the various denominations, I am totally cynical and
just want to see some actual works. While I aspire to and enjoy perfection in
design, be it aesthetic or informational or whatever, someone walking up with
a tool or product whose entire innovation is that the guts work better
according to a particular school of thought, I get uninterested really fast.
