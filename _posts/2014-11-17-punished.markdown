title: 'Punished for the hubris of believing that our lives were good'
---

> Maybe she'd be all right if we hadn't had the impulse to thank whatever gods or demons might lurk beyond the horizon for our lives that seemed so right, and say no more than that; maybe she suffered for our being humbly grateful for what we had and not thinking that we needed to beg for that state to continue. Punished for the hubris of believing that our lives were good and in no need of improvement.
