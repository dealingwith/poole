[Textism: Oh, look, another web app][2]

> So I spent the last few days knocking this together. It works on three
principles: first, that anyone who wants to can have their vote counted;
second, that things people find interesting are more important than people who
find things interesting; and third, that by any means necessary, web-strategy,
social-media, online-marketing webcocks – unaware as they are of how toxic
their presence is in the arenas they cannot shut up about – must and shall be
filtered out of view.


There’s some fancy albeit inchoate weighting logic going on under the surface,
and I’ve got a few vaguely neato features in the works, though it is as they
say very beta. It will I hope grow, and, as more people are added to the
voting ranks, be a reliable source for funny, weird, obnoxious, entertaining,
inspiring, webcock-less, tiny little fragments of life.
