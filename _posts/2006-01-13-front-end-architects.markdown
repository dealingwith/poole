_Right off the top of my head, I see ASP.Net's initial and complete disregard
for web standards and Websphere's equally dismal use of web standards (We're
talking tables and spacer gifs here.) as being the perfect examples. These are
huge frameworks used on enterprise projects that output markup that would look
bad even by 1999 standards.

How is it possible that such large and 'professional' products could ignore
what is arguably the easiest aspect of the whole project? The static code. The
reason is that, while I'm sure both products are great from a technical
standpoint, the markup, CSS, and other client-side technologies were a
complete afterthought. Presentation logic, markup, and behavior are all
intermingled with nary a thought towards accessibility, web standards, or
clean separation of the front-end technologies. Raise your hand if you think
that's an acceptable practice in 2006._
