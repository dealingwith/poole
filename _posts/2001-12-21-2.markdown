My endless fall indeed
What grace is big enough to dig out this seed?

I feel like things will never get done
I feel like pain from the things i've done
Will always come back to get me
Karma
Instant Karma

No grace
Just Karma

You Shit.

Yeah that's what I thought.

Given me up to the demon of karma

No?
