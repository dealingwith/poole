Getting myself warmed up for what I hope to be a tremendous week of coding, I ever so slightly tweaked DJDC to save bandwidth: I hide the text for any entry older than the last 3 days-of-entries. (Currently, the 3rd day is already "hidden" by default.)



Much more bandwidth saving stuff and other cul things coming soon.
