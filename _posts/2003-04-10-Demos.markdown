In said fear and trembling.



I have updated my music link to go to <a href="http://artists.iuma.com/IUMA/Bands/hope_against_hope/">the daniel wayne miller americana project IUMA page</a>, which has on it 2 new songs--American Dream Town and Just Say Yes--and a new mix of Numb Us, which collectively make up the new demo. I also threw up the old stuff worth keeping.



IUMA isn't great, but it is a lot better than mp3.com now...as many songs as you want, can seperate them into "albums", and a Real audio format. I didn't have any problems uploading the mp3's. No strings attached; I just hope they can stick around; they had an emergency a year and a half ago and almost went bye-bye; fortunately someone bought them and kept the site up. It's a charity gig for them I'm sure.



If anyone wonders about the glamorous life of a DIY musician, here are two shots of me recording American Dream Town:

Like I said, everything else is done on the floor.



Here is the text for the demo sleeve:<blockquote>
<strong>TheDanielWayneMillerAmericanaProject - demo v.0.2 - 01. Just Say Yes</strong> <em>Just say yes, just say ok. Say, "You're right, I'm just perfect today."</em> <strong>02. Numb Us</strong> <em>It's like the first time--it's over before it even began.</em> <strong>03. American Dream Town</strong> <em>Don't hate me 'cuz I'm beautiful. Don't go lookin' for my long lost soul. Some time and money is all you need. They'll give you a shot and start to kneed you face like dough--there's no need to know yer true light within, just spin spin spin. Slap a logo on your chest and don't worry 'bout the rest.</em> <strong>- contact: info@danielsjourney.com - web: http://danielsjourney.com - audio instructions:</strong> listen either very softly or very loudly with the washing machine on and after no less than two pints, unless you are an alcoholic, then please skip the pints, or a baptist, in which case skip the entire demo if you would <strong>- thank you for choosing to consume quality American Dream products</strong></blockquote>

<strong>mistakes we knew we were making</strong>:



<em>"Theese town, theese American Dream Touuuun?"</em>

Yes. This is alt.country after all. Sort of. Think an uptempo Nick Cave.



<em>Drums and voice way out front?</em>

Yeah. My Korg recorder should have a big sticker on it: ALL YOUR MIDTONES ARE BELONG TO US. Sounds good in the 'phones.



<em>Numb US vocal 2?</em>

Yeah. Couple fuck ups that I kept. I say "ever" instead of "even" one time, and it's so far back it's practically an audio easter egg, but at the end of the bridge I was trying to sing the octave on an already high note and my voice just stopped and I said "shit".



<em>Second drum track on American Dream Town?</em>

The Hip Hop 2 setting. Old school baby. Flipped the channels during mixdown. Highlight of the whole thing for me was nailing it coming out of the bridge. Not exactly like *playing* the drums, but considering what I've got (just what's built into the Korg), I think I do a good job.
