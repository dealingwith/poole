danielsjourney.com/art is finally up, about 3 months later than planned. There has been the framework of the Daniel Miller Band (/art/music) site up since June, a few of you saw it maybe. It is my favorite design of anything I've ever done. Installations has been up for about two weeks. Writings and Photography are, alas, still underconstruction.

Go. Explore. Play. Request passwords. Let me know if you see anything needs fixing. And let me know what you think, please...especially if it's good stuff.
