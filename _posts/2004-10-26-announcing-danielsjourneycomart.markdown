<strong><a href="http://danielsjourney.com/art/">danielsjourney.com/art</a></strong> is finally up, about 3 months later than planned. There has been the framework of the <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/art/music/">Daniel Miller Band</a> (/art/music) site up since June, a few of you saw it maybe. It is my favorite design of anything I've ever done. <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/art/installations/">Installations</a> has been up for about two weeks. <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/art/writing/">Writings</a> and <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/art/photography/">Photography</a> are, alas, still underconstruction.
