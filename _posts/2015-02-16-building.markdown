title: 'If we want it to get better, we need to start building what we want to come next...'
---

> Everyone's spending increasingly more consumption time...snacking on bite-sized social content...

> Publishers are relying more on social traffic not because Google's squeezing them out, but because that's where everyone went...

> Every hour we spend on Twitter or Facebook instead of reading and writing elsewhere is just making this worse...

> Social...we've swung too far in that direction for our own good, as both producers and consumers. I hope the pendulum starts to swing back soon, because it hasn't yet. It's going to get worse before it gets better, if it ever does.

> If we want it to get better, we need to start pushing back against the trend, modernizing blogs, and building what we want to come next.
