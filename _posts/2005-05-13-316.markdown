"[If you buy the new Dave Matthews Band Stand Up CD, do not put it in your
Windows computer][1]. I did and it popped up an annoying software installation
and I said no to it just like I did 9 years ago when I first saw that happen
with Fiona Apple%u2019s Tidal. It then ejected the CD. First strike! I just
wanted to listen to it. So I did the logical thing and pushed the CD drive
back in, and the CD spun up and then the computer crashed and rebooted.
Needless to say, this is a very bad thing."
