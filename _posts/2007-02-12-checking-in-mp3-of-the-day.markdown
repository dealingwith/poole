I'm in this amazing, horrible, beautiful, tragic, mind-blowing, totally
incapacitating state of limbo right now. It's making doing much of anything
difficult. There's no indication of how long it might last. Two out of the
last four nights I haven't slept. I'm exhausted and wide awake at the same
time. "Bittersweet" does not do the situation justice. Words in general do
not.

I have been writing alot. Music that is. 8 tunes since November. I've posted
one, Cliche, so I'm pretty far behind. Although, I'm pretty selective about
posting home-recorded demos..._especially_ after recording at [Pleasantry
Lane][1] and knowing what is possible for these tunes.

So anyway, here's another one: [Don't Make Me Cry][2].

Pretty freakin' simple tune. Just sometimes there's so much tragedy in the
world, it can be overwhelming, and you just want a break.

If you take a gander at [my recent tracks][3], you notice I had a few _hours_
with the new Damien Rice record last night*. It's still playing.

* I also wrote, recorded, mixed, burned, and designed art work for a new tune.
You'll see it there too. No idea if I'll post that one!
