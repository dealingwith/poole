> Many monsters stand between us & realization of Immediatist goals. For
instance our own ingrained unconscious alienation might all to easily be
mistaken for a virtue, especially when contrasted with crypto-authoritarian
pap passed off as "community," or with various upscale versions of "leisure."
Isn't it natural to take the _dandyism noir_ of curmudgeonly hermits for some
kind of heroic individualism, when the only visible contrast is Club Med
commodity socialism, or the [gemutlich][3] masochism of the Victim Cults? To
be doomed & cool naturally appeals more to noble souls than to be saved &
cozy.

...What must be overcome is not individuality per se, but rather the addiction
to bitter loneliness which characterizes consciousness in the 20th century
(which is by & large not much more than a re-run of the 19th).

...The first & most innocent-seeming obstacle to any Immediatist project will
be the "busyness" or "need to make a living" faced by each of its associates.

...Yes, perhaps it's true we can't "live" with a job -- although I hope we're
grown-up enough to know the difference between _life_ & the accumulation of a
bunch of fucking _gadgets_.
