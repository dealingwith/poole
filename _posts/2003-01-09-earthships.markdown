Now that I created this new category, I'll probly shove more things into it than appropriate (kinda like "minutia," and yes I like that spelling better).

Via <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/santafe_earthship.html">this ftrain article</a> I found <a href="http://www.earthship.org/">earthship.org</a>. Really amazing things in sustainable living. I of course head straight for the pictures and there are some really cool things done with houses made of tires and stuff. Anyway, of course I love anyone doing anything "sustainable," perhaps after we all figure out how to create this "sustainable information economy" we can all move into our sustainable earthship homes and live happily ever after.
