Now that I created this new category, I'll probly shove more things into it than appropriate (kinda like "minutia," and yes I like that spelling better).



via <a href="http://www.ftrain.com/santafe_earthship.html">this ftrain article</a> I found <a href="http://www.earthship.org/">earthship.org</a>. Really amazing things in sustainable living. I of course head straight for the pictures and there are some really cool things done with houses made of tires and stuff. :) Anyway, of course I love anyone doing anything "sustainable," perhaps after we all figure out how to create this "sustainable information economy" (<a href="http://integration.danielsjourney.com">ref</a>) we can all move into our sustainable earthship homes and live happily ever after.
