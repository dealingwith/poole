<i>first post from greenbelt</i> and i'm incredibly short on time so no -linkies- here! i'm chilling here with wood from -john herron project-. i just ran into him at -visions- an alternative worship service group. i also saw -over the rhine- today...amazing amazing amazing...things have been really great hanging out with -steve- -jonny- and the whole grace crew. 

wood says hi by the way.

rained today.

over the rhine. what can i say. by the way, they are coming to north virginia at the end of september. in case you want to catch up and catch a great band, i'll of course be there.

next couple days will be the more eventful ones, today the festival just started at 5...more little stories and all to come...hopefully some light to share from this bright spot in the universe right now...
