[Leland Sklar's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs5yDeiOgkyRZGZGphlSbIw). You know Leland Sklar as the bass player with the giant beard in Phil Collin's band. He [also played with less-known bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Sklar#Selected_albums) such as Jackson Browne, Lyle Lovett, Warren Zevon, Toto, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire and like, I don't know, literally 100 other artists you have absolutely heard of. Well it turns out he's exactly the wise man speaking into a webcam we need in this economy.

Virtuosic German musicians Martin Miller, et al., performing [Easy Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtUKEfpNTNI). We'll forgive them for not attributing the song to Philip Bailey. I first discovered these cats via their [Ultimate Genesis Medley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhJEcRx6CXc&t=2s), 27 minutes of amazingness that I just watched for the second time and makes me need to set up my acoustic drum kit again real bad. _(Where, oh where?)_ And oh, yeah, [this cover of Rush's YYZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_HeVyc5-GY).

Lauren and Daniel Goans of [Lowland Hum](https://lowlandhum.com/), who I have mentioned twice before on this blog _([Lowland Hum](/2020/02/08/lowland-hum/), [More Denison](/2020/03/21/more-denison/))_. They have a [send-a-song](https://lowlandhum.com/send-a-song) service that is obscenely under-priced. I was desperate for a mother's day present and working at the last minute when their email newsletter reminded me about this unbelievable offering. I quadrupled their asking price because it was last minute and also because _come on_. I didn't hear back. I just hoped it would arrive on the day requested. 

_Good Lord did it ever_. It was perfect and touching and amazing and catchy and made Carissa cry. It's not for me to share but [here it is on her 'book](https://www.facebook.com/carissabyers/posts/10158578200553254).

5/5, would buy a song from Lowland Hum again, except pay at least 5x the asking price.

Oh yeah, Denison. His new record is out. Buy it.
