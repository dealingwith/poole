[i miss republicans][1]: _My original point was -- Republicans used to be the
guys who put the brakes on this shit. A sad chuckle, a little head shake.
"Who's going to pay for this?" they'd say, frowning over national budgets.
"Where are the facts? The research?" They'd take out their little red pens and
buzzkill our little dreams of nationalized health care or solar-powered
windmills or maglev trains, and then go back to banning pornography while
secretly screwing around on their wives. But you know what? A lot of times,
they were right.

We needed those guys. They were a dull but crucial part of the national
dialogue. (And they knew their scotches.)_
