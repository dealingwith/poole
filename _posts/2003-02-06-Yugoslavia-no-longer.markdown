<i>Yugoslavia on Tuesday officially buried what remained of the bloodied federation after a decade of Balkan wars and formed a loose union of Serbia and Montenegro to take its place.



The federal assembly cleared the final hurdle for establishing the Western-brokered state union by passing its founding charter with an absolute majority in both houses, consigning the name Yugoslavia to history after almost 75 years.



"I hereby declare the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro adopted," speaker Dragoljub Micunovic told an historic joint session after the two houses voted separately.</i> [<a href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2003/02/06/193500">ref</a>]





We had been talking about this for a while in our Area Studies class--one class we had Montenegro's special envoy to the US speak to us, and found out all about the joint institutions and the seperate institutions; at that time Serbia had not budgeted any money towards the joint institutions...heh...don't know if they finally did, I guess so if the charter passed. Nobody really called it Yugoslavia anymore anyway, but now it's official.
