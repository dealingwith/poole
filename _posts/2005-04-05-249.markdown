[Great paintings, for example, get you laid][1] in a way that great computer
programs never do. Even not-so-great paintings - in fact, any slapdash attempt
at slapping paint onto a surface - will get you laid more than writing
software, especially if you have the slightest hint of being a tortured,
brooding soul about you. For evidence of this I would point to my college
classmate Henning, who was a Swedish double art/theatre major and on most days
could barely walk.
