[The Postmarks][2] are a south Florida band of repute. I knew Jonathan Wilkins
when I lived there, he played drums for the same band I (briefly) did, [The
Freakin' Hott][3] (who are amazing as well, and have been an often topic of
this blog).

Anyhoo, they came up in a [last.fm][4] station I was playing the other day, so
I went to catch up, and saw that not only do they have a new record out, but
they have [a bunch of mp3's available on their site for your downloading
pleasure][5].
