It is now "Links." I didn't like the way "Elsewhere" was displaying in the archives, where Elsewhere often had wide images, comments, or full URL's. "Uber-Elsewhere" lived a short life as a category and is now back to plain-ol' "Elsewhere." <em>Links</em> is the new category for the right-hand sidebar action.
