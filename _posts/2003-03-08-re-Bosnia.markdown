Here are some notes I took at a recent area studies class regarding Bosnia, specifically it's government, Dayton, and keeping the peace:

<blockquote><em>Dayton has left Bosnia ungovernable as written.</em></blockquote>There are <em>13</em> prime ministers in BiH.


International soldiers, once 400,000, currently 20,000, planned decrease to 10,000.<blockquote><em>The principle of conflict-of-interest hasn't been well established in Bosnia.</em></blockquote>I can add that that is the case is most of the eastern block.



...



I also take little notes and write questions to myself during such times. For example:



<em>Time stood still

clock broke at 1 exactly but the sec. hand kept moving</em>



? How do I, as a civilian, culturally, teach people, communicate:

-peace vs. fear

-humanity vs. nationality



...



<blockquote><em>There is tremendous multi-ethnic cooperation in organized crime.</em></blockquote>
