When the truth cannot be seen or found, it is a bad thing...no matter who is right and who is wrong. Confusion and darkness is a cancer that will eat everything in its path, the righteous and unrighteous alike.

>At the heart of [evil] is the proclivity for deception. The essence of evil is to deceive, distort and confuse. It prospers by imitating that which is good and true, only to invade and colonise it with death.

>...evil creates confusion wherever it spreads. Issues which were previously clear become mired in layers of subtlety until no one can be sure what is happening any more. And even when terrible things are being done, it is not at all certain how they occur or who is responsible.
