I've seen a couple of these...have owned Welcome to Sarajevo for a while, it is one of my top 5 films of all time and most likely instrumental in the calling I felt towards that city. I'm going to be checking out most of the rest of these (except for the cheesy hollywood Savior, which if it's biased at all I'm not interested in, and Tito and Me, which I've seen) (another hollywood but decent film not on this list is Behind Enemy Lines).

I'm going to be reading it asap (within two months i hope). We're currently watching the BBC documentary of the same name in our Area Studies class. It's quite good and I'm sad it's not available on Amazon. I will continue to look for it elsewhere and post anything I find.
