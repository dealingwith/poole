_David Galbraith--The greening of The Valley, why sustainable companies
matter_ `dead link`. Good stuff. In regards to the big web2.0 success stories (Myspace,
Skype and YouTube):

> In a parallel universe, all three companies could have folded, leaving them
in the same position as their numerous competitors. Their success was not
planned and was very high risk. They are species that survived in a particular
evolutionary niche that opened up, they were not 'intelligently designed'.
