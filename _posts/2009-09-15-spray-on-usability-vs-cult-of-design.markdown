[An older but still very applicable post from daringfireball.net][1]:

> It’s not something every programmer can learn. Most programmers don’t have
any aptitude for UI design whatsoever. It’s an art, and like any art, it
requires innate ability. You can learn to be a better writer. You can learn to
be a better illustrator. But most people can’t write and can’t draw, and no
amount of practice or education is going to make them good at it. Improved,
yes; good, no.


Conversely, some people who are good UI designers aren’t programmers. But the
rock stars are the guys who can do both, and they are few and far between.


...Great software developers don’t design for morons. They design for smart,
perceptive people — people just like themselves. They have profound respect
for their users.

I actually disagree with Mr. Gruber on his last point. I'm not sure the
designers of really great user interfaces have a _profound respect_ for their
users.


I think a designer's relationship with his or her audience is like that of an
honest believer's relationship with God: respect, sure, but mostly punctuated
by fear, frustration, doubt and an infuriating love. When one spends hours
moving dots on a screen for the pleasure of an invisible other one has entered
the realm of religion. I think being able to not only live in that tension but
_thrive_ and _make good decisions while in it_ is the aspect of design that
makes it more an art (or a priesthood). That we actualize our thoughts and
feelings with text (code) that becomes objects is no more relevant to our real
calling than if our tools were paints and brushes.
