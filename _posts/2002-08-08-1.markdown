Got <a href="http://sevenmagazine.org">sevenmagazine.org</a> done last night in a fit of debugging. I call the architecture <i>fearfully named XCMS v.0.10</i>, and it will continue to be refined in the coming months. I've already found a couple of things missing on the site, but none of it has to do with the architecture or code.
