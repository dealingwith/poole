In case you didn't know, there is a [Freakin' Hott fansite][1], created
primarily to catalog the highly entertaining emails from Maggie and co., but
also with any other pertinent info. xgiz, if you want to be an author, please
let me know. i don't have a lot of time for improving or adding content.
