[![][1]][2][Andrew Bird - Imitosis][3]

> He's keeping busy Yeah he's bleeding stones With his machinations and his
palindromes It was anything but hear the voice Anything but hear the voice It
was anything but hear the voice That says that we're all basically alone

Poor Professor Pynchon had only good intentions When he put his Bunsen burners
all away And turning to a playground in a Petri dish Where single cells would
swing their fists At anything that looks like easy prey In this nature show
that rages every day It was then he heard his intuition say

We were all basically alone And despite what all his studies had shown That
what's mistaken for closeness Is just a case of mitosis And why do some show
no mercy While others are painfully shy Tell me doctor can you quantify He
just wants to know the reason why The reason why

Why do they congregate in groups of four Scatter like a billion spores And let
the wind just carry them away How can kids be so mean Our famous doctor tried
to glean As he went home at the end of the day In this nature show that rages
every day It was then he heard his intuition say

We were all basically alone Despite what all his studies had shown That what's
mistaken for closeness Is just a case of mitosis Sure fatal doses of
malcontent through osmosis And why do some show no mercy While others are
painfully shy Tell me doctor, can you quantify The reason why?
