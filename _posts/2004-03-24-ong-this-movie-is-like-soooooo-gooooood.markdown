So I'm waiting for this blogspot blog to load and it is like OMG SO slow.

So I thought I'd tell you that the movie The Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless
Mind is one of the, if not THE, most brilliant movie ever. Maybe not the BEST
movie ever, but definately maybe the most brilliant. I am going to end up
seeing it at least three times in the theatres, which is, like, a record for
me.
