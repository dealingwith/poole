if checking out <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/policy/2003/02/24/perspectives.html">this interview with Cory</a> at O'Reilly doesn't make you want to read his book, not much, including the fact you can download it for free, will.<blockquote>...the recording industry has a story of, "We do two really important roles. One is to make music available and the other is to compensate artists." But one of the things we know is that 80 percent of all of the music ever released isn't for sale anywhere in the world. And another thing we know is that 97 percent of the artists signed to a recording contract earn less than &#36;600 per year off of it. So Napster doesn't have a better track record at compensating artists, but it sure as shit had a better track record of making music available.</blockquote>
