I had run across <a href="http://www.jeansandatshirt.com">this site</a> a few weeks ago (via <a href=" http://www.themorningnews.org">morningnews</a>) but today i ran across it again (via <a href="http://www.soubriquet.net/">soubriquet</a> via <a href="http://www.boboroshi.com/log/">boboroshi</a>), this time straight into their <a href="http://www.jeansandatshirt.com/monthlymix.html">monthly mix</a> page, which has 35 well-picked tunes for you downloading enjoyment. So far I can vouch for all but the last song on the 1st record (but that's just me). The second record has many better-known artists, but that's cool too. Hey, I appreciate what jeansandateeshirt are doing. The artists represented there (and their management and labels) should appreciate it, too, because my chances of buying some of these records has gone up dramatically.
