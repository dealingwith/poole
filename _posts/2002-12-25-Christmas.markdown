In Florida enjoying Christmas with Miriam's family. Lots of fun and interesting experiences. Florida is definately a totally different world...even as we flew over Weston and Sunrise and Plantation on our landing approach, we could sense that things have changed for us, that we are no longer aliens living in this world, but just visiting for a week, thank goodness.



Anyway, not much else to say; if you have not yet checked out <a href="http://127.0.0.1/djdc/index.php?archive=blog_2002_12_15.xml&id_pass=70">my Christmas post</a>, you can now...
