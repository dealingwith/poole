> ...i think one of the greatest injustices of the world is that if youre in
the bathroom washing your hands, and it smells really bad like booboo, but you
didnt doit, then someone walks in and sees you washing your hands and gives
you a dirty look like, "you disgusting human, you actually CREATED that smell,
ugh!!" cause they think you did it, just really sucks. i really hate that. it
happened to me once. [#][1]


Like, OMG, yeah, I really hate that.

Like, OMG, I think I'm going to move and have to say goodbye to all my really
important lifelong friends and that's, like, you know, really hard.
