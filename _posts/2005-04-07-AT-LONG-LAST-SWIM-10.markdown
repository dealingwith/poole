Despite yours truly having a temperature of over 100 for the last 24 hours, <a href="http://underde.com">we've</a> managed to get the SWIM site in shape enough to put the link for the download up there. We finished the 1.0 release <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/blog/index.php?file=2005_04.xml&id=31232534">last Friday</a> and announced it to our email list. Now we have the license online, as well as forums, etc.

That product worked. This product rocks.">long time coming.</a> Creating and releasing software has been, <a href="http://integrationresearch.org/taxonomy/page/or/60" title="Smart Commons and Smart Commons Collection">once again</a>, a longer-than-expected, oftentimes frustrating to the bone experience, <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/blog/index.php?file=2005_03.xml&id=30112501">even up to the last minute</a>. But I am proud.
