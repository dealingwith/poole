So I think only Salim and The Girl know about my idea to do spoken word. Oh I
might have mentioned it to SJ. Anyhoo, I want to do a 2-disc release--EP +
interesting shit. Within the latter would be some spoken word stuff--like
[this][1] which I one-took on my home recorder mostly just to see if it still
worked or what. I'm reading [this][2], in case you don't crank the mid's right
away and can't make out what I'm saying. The really cool part was I cut the
guitar with the wrong mic on, and just played what I thought might be long
enough (although I wasn't really worried about it because I thought I was
going to have to loop in on the computer anyway)....ended up being the
*perfect* length...
