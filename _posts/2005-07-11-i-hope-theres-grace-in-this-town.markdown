those who want to keep up know where to look

From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Riddell">Riddell</a>'s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0829814566/qid=1121279099/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-5131049-5514530?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Sacred Journey</a>:

> At the heart of evil is the proclivity for deception. The essence of evil is to deceive, distort and confuse. It prospers by imitating that which is good and true, only to invade and colonise it with death.

> ...evil creates confusion wherever it spreads. Issues which were previously clear become mired in layers of subtlety until no one can be sure what is happening any more. And even when terrible things are being done, it is not at all certain how they occur or who is responsible.

> ...in the continuous spectrum between bad and evil, there is some indeterminate region in which a boundary is crossed. Usually it is occasioned by repeated and unrepentant acts of deception. Sustained lying seems to create a vulnerability to a deeper corruption. Psychologists speak of dissociation, a mechanism by which people are able to perform horrendous deeds yet create enough psychic distance for themselves that they fail to feel any guilt or remorse...

...

> ...It is in denial that real troubles start. When we begin not only to try to convince others, but also to believe for ourselves that there is nothing bad within us, then we are flirting with real danger. In self-deception genuine evil may gain a foothold, festering in hidden darkness until an opporunity presents itself to erupt in a seething force which sweeps all before it.

> ...But...deceit and lies can never overcome truth, however much damage they may appear to cause in the short term. Ingrained dishonesty and the evil it produces are ultimately self-defeating.

#### the farewell mix:

Michael Miller - Grace Town

> i hope there's grace in this town  
> because i need grace right now  
> i'm sick of walking down these streets of tarifa  
> and waiting for some magic revelation  
> or secret jesus to appear  
> and erase you

When I'd listen to this song the last couple years, I thought that last lyric was "and grace you." Now I'm thinking I like that a lot better than the real lyric.

Michael Miller - When We Come To

> everybody knows it's just a lie  
> except me and you  
> sipping tea with shisha in the dark  
> and making stories up about who we are  
> everybody knows it's just pretend  
> except me and you  
> when we come to...

> addie fills the holes up in her arm  
> to kill the little secrets in her heart  
> everybody knows they do it too  
> except me and you  
> when we come to...

and:

Sufjan Stevens - Casimir Pulaski Day

> Oh the glory that the lord has made  
> And the complications you could do without   
> When I kissed you on the mouth  
> Tuesday night at the bible study  
> We lift our hands and pray over your body  
> But nothing ever happens  
> Oh the glory that the lord has made  
> And the complications when I see his face  
> In the morning in the window  
> Oh the glory when he took our place  
> But he took my shoulders and he shook my face  
> And he takes and he takes and he takes
