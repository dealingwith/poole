I'm having a hard lunch hour right now. I'm sick and hungry at the same time and we have very little food in the house (my fault).



At the same time I'm overwhelmed with all the things I have to do. But the problem with my situation (although most people would love to have this problem) is that everything must be done proactively. I have no person or thing demanding that it gets done besides my dreams. And they aren't easy things. They take work. This is easy. Blogging is easy. This is why I blog. This is why I shouldn't blog. :)
