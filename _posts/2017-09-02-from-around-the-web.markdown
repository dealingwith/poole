One of my favorite records is on the list, Boards of Canada's [Music Has the Right to Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Has_the_Right_to_Children). Despite being a relatively long-time fan of BoC, it is only now that I'm learning about [Hexagon Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon_Sun), the artistic collective they are a part of. 

> The existence of Hexagon Sun and oblique references to it in interviews, web sites and album packaging have contributed to what many people regard as the mythological aura surrounding Boards of Canada. Opinions on this subject differ greatly; certain fans of Boards of Canada and their record label Warp regard Hexagon Sun as a mysterious cult, while others believe that it is simply a title for the band's recording studio.

In case you didn't already know, I covered Boards of Canada for the opening track on my last record, [Form](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/album/form), with the help of Benj Pocta of [The Beaten Sea](https://thebeatensea.bandcamp.com/). (He also sang [Adios, Au Revoir, Auf Wiedersehen](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/adios-au-revoir-auf-wiedersehen) on the [Memorial](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/album/memorial) record.)

I recently found this photo of The Beaten Sea playing at the [Winspear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_and_Bill_Winspear_Opera_House), [Jamie Wilson](http://jamiewilson.io/) pausing to sing just for Margot. She was transfixed.

If you're anything like me, by which I mean into music and technology, this video should blow your mind at least a little bit:
