The usual: "bucket full of nice", "wheelbarrow full of nice", etc., then...

"I'm a doobie...a doogie...wait what kind of truck is that...?"

"A dueley?"

"Yeah, I'm a dueley full of nice."

then...

"I'm a dumptruck full of nice and I'm fixin' to dump it in your driveway."

"I'm so nice they're fixin' to put me up on the shelf in the Apple store."
