I'm at Greenbelt</a> until next week. I leave tonight and get into London tomorrow morning, and we go straight to the festival. I am planning on helping Grace and Vaux out with whatever as they set up their <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk/festival/2002/lineup/worship/">installations</a>. My friend <a href="http://www.smallritual.org">Steve</a> is helping me out by hosting me on either side of the festival, letting me just tag along with his crew at the festival, even meeting me at the airport! Super cool since this is last minute and I'm pretty unorganized! :)

SO I have to run and finish last minute things today, and I won't have another chance to blog for sure until the festival....so standbye! :)
