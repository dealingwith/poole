Chuck was right: the movie is better than the book; tighter, tells a couple of the story elements in a better way. Also Chuck's writing has grown a lot since then! It is cool to see that; that even a huge writer like Chuck improves from his first to his 5th. Can't wait for the new one to come out this summer.



Good, still Chuck, I'm a huge fan of course, but either read this one before any others or all the others before this one.
