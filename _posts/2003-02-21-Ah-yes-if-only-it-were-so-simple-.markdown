Matthew Baldwin

The Morning News



<em><b>Bush:</b> ...I must confess that, until recently, I was vexed by this very point; namely, does Saddam have, in his possession, weapons of mass destruction? As our treatment of North Korea illustrates, the United States' policy towards a rogue nation is contingent upon the answer to this most vital of questions.



But in the last few weeks, I have come to realize my folly in analyzing the issue of WMD-ownership in strict accordance with Newtonian-physics. Once I jettisoned my preconceived notions of reality, the matter became-



<b>Marlin:</b> I'm sorry, did you say 'Newtonian physics?'



<b>Bush:</b> Precisely. If you view Iraq in a classical Newtonian framework, then you must concede that they either do or do not have weapons of mass destruction. It is this narrow mindset that causes such confusion in the uninformed.



But, over President's Day weekend at Camp David, I delved into the collected writings of Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger, and now have no recourse but to conclude that Saddam both has and does not have weapons of mass destruction.</em>
