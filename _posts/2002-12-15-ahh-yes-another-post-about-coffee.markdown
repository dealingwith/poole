Barista Action Figure (`dead link`)

> Meet Nico. She's the barista who pulls your morning espresso. No other barista in town makes a latte like Nico. Her beans are always freshly ground, she never tamps the filter basket too tight and her foam is perfect: thick and decadent, like a pillow of edible clouds...

Nice tat, too.
