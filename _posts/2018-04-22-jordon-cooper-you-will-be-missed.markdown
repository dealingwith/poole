[My Last Post](http://www.jordoncooper.com/my-last-post/)

> If you are reading this, it means I am no longer here.  The liver and colon cancer stopped toying with me on March 26, 2018.  The last laugh is on the cancer, it is going to the grave with me. I was 44 and glad to be done with the damn cancer.

Jordon [was blogging before I was](http://www.jordoncooper.com/2001/06/) and never stopped until the very end. He was a key voice in the post-evangelical community in the early 00's. Like most of us, he later broadened his focus, covering subjects such as urbanism and technology. He mixed in personal events, giving us insight into an authentic life. 

I never had the opportunity to meet Jordon in person, but he had a profound influence on me.

You can help out his family on [GoFundMe](http://www.gofundme.com/JordonCooper).
