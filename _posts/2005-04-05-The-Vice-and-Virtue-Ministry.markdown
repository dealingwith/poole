Last Saturday was <a href="http://happybullets.com/">The Happy Bullets</a> CD release party at <a href="http://goodrecords.com/">Good Records</a>. Since you missed it, you have another chance, <a title="Tah-Dah's and Happy Bullets CD Release show with FISHBOY">April 7th @ Rubber Gloves
Denton, TX</a> and/or <a title="Tah-Dah's and Happy Bullets CD Release show with The Theater Fire">April 8th  Sons of Hermann Hall
Dallas, TX</a>.



This is one of those things that <a href="http://daniel.integrationresearch.org/blog/index.php?file=2004_11.xml&id=22235616">was supposed to happen last year</a>. A few days after <a href="http://fray.com/events/fray_day_8_dallas/">Fray Day</a>, the Bullets came into <a href="http://irgallery.net">the Gallery</a> to record an acoustic set on my <a href="http://www.korg.com/gear/info.asp?a_prod_no=D12&category_id=3">D12</a>. It was a great time, and, considering the equipment, a really great recording. It just took me months to get around to spending the hour mixing it down.

Two of these tunes are not available on <a href="http://www.undeniablerecords.net/buy.htm" title="BUY IT NOW!!! SERIOUS!">their new record</a>.



And I'll leave you with this:
