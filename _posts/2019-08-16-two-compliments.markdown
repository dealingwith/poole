I've received two really meaningful compliments in the last week:

One was in regards to my bicycling abilities. Not my fitness, but my bike handling and general panache. The compliment was something like: "You're the best riding partner I've ever had," followed by some additional comments about my bike handling and general situational awareness.

The other compliment was in regards to my laugh. The compliment was that it was authentic, boisterous and full of joy. As someone that doesn't identify as "full of joy," I took this as high praise.
