Tonight I went to a concert by THE central Penn band, <a href="http://www.badlees.com/main.html">the Badlees</a>. I also caught some great ~opening~ acts. You must read the rest of this entry. :)

I love living walking distance from one of the greatest Americana clubs ever, <a href="http://www.iotaclubandcafe.com/">IOTA</a>. Tonight was the Badless and I had been looking forward to seeing them for some time. Last time I saw them, I think, was 1993.

I also caught <a href="http://www.breesharp.com/">Bree Sharp</a>, whose only fault in this world is looking exactly like Britney fucking Spears. Except Bree here? She rocks. She has a song, <a href="http://www.christianpornmachine.com/media/BreeSharp-01-america.mp3">America</a>, check the <a href="http://www.breesharp.com/lyrics/america.asp">lyrics</a> (I'm also providing an mp3 in blatant copyright infringement but I know most of you reading will have no chance to hear this music...and you WILL buy these records...no pressure). But little did I know until I got home and dropped the CD in the player that this is the <a href="http://www.christianpornmachine.com/media/BreeSharp-02-davidD.mp3">David Duchovny song</a> chick! Awesome! Ha ha! I have no idea where, when, or how I've heard that song in the past but I have. The above pic is the only one here that isn't mine, just FYI in case you couldn't tell ha ha.



So, the Badlees ended with a song I was going to request (in a loud voice) at some point, but fortunately even without said request they played <a href="http://www.christianpornmachine.com/media/Badlees-ILikedYouBetter.mp3">I Liked You Better When You Hated Yourself</a>, with a nice story told right in the middle of the song. Rock n effin Roll my friend. Rock n Roll.

Then I walked home.
