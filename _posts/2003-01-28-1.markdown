A heart that's full up like a landfill, 

a job that slowly kills you, 

bruises that won't heal

You were so tired, happy,

bring down the government, 

they don't, they don't speak for her

I'll take the quiet life, a handshake of carbon monoxide



No alarms and no surprises, no alarms and no surprises

No alarms and no surprises

Silent, silent

This is my final fit, my final bellyache with

No alarms and no surprises, no alarms and no surprises

No alarms and no surprises, please



Such a pretty house, such a pretty garden

No alarms and no surprises, no alarms and no surprises

No alarms and no surprises, please
