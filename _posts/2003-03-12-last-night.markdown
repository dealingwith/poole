The show was ok last night--the Zebra is
a very swanky lounge in Georgetown, and somehow Americana music
with lyrics like 



<blockquote>don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful</blockquote>

<blockquote>there are those with social success that they call
being blessed</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>a house in the 'burbs and a bitchin SUV is how I'm
never gonna wind up (<a

just didn't seem to resonate. Dunno why?! Yeah, especially 

<blockquote>short fat men in khakis jerk off</blockquote>

with the short guy in khakis. Maybe tonight will go off
better.



Millions of thanks to John for the opp...his very clean set of
delay-heavy (I quote myself: "We love delay") and intrincate
tunes meshed a tad bit more with the ambient electronica house
music that played before and after our set. He even managed two
Buckley covers.



I wrote a little, by hand (don't know how Chuck does it, but it's
ok), during John's set. This is really sad: I haven't written
(fiction) since last summer. Last night I wrote 1/2 of a (very
short) bit I started thinking about at Greenbelt last year. I was
going to write it there for a session they had for writers. Never
happened. Really never happened. It is crazy, pathetic, and
mostly sad that I just now got around to writing it.



Anyway, I very well may read it tonight in-between some songs.
I'll post it tomorrow just for something to do.



The rest of the highlights from last night:



Thanks Mike for making it out for my set. Always better to play
for 1-4 than none.



The guys bathroom smelled really nice. They had an appropriately
swanky plug-in smelly thing in there.



Played two covers, both by Jews. I'm all about ethnic diversity.
Oh yeah. Funny bit: I mentioned that Lukewarm was a "punk song by
a Jewish guy" which got a bit of a rise out of a (Jewish?) woman
who was (actually!) listening. I had to explain that there is a
lyric in the second verse that required that context.



Forgot my set list, so I had to make it up from memory. Here's
how it ended up: Numb Us, Just Say Yes, Really Need a Chorus, Gospel Song,
Lukewarm, The Future That Was (totally was not going to play that
song, but played it spot on w/o lyrics anyway--woohoo!), Closed
for the Year, American Dream Town. Of course there were stories in-between songs
too.



Way more of the same, with even more earnest feelings, tonight! C u there!
