[Monomythical](https://nayafia.substack.com/) is the best newsletter I'm subscribed to. 

Just a sample from a recent installment:

> Weirdly, Twitter feels like the most boring place I could be right now. It feels too Old World, like trudging to an office building when I've just arrived in the disco afterlife. I'd rather be a spooky spirit ghost haunting the radio waves with my friends, exploring the backwaters of the internet, gleefully playing pranks and dissolving into fits of giggles.

> ...now, it's the homegrown apps, the suboptimal apps, the janky apps, that give us the texture and variety we're craving, while the sleek apps, the Made by Facebook apps, the 99.9%-uptime apps, feel like chipped plastic, hard and hollow and unappealing.

She also has a [blog](https://nadiaeghbal.com/) and a [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/) coming out.
