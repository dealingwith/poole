Will be using LJ a bit more* for work-related research documentation. But, um,
used tags for the first time so I might actually be able to find stuff again,
and it only creates a link to a combined tag nomenclature? WTCrap? Will have
to play with this a bit more.

Immediate update: Ah, comma-separated...but then I have to actually address-
bar-hack to get a combined view? ...Again: nope, no combining...going against
standard, spaces are turned into + and the entire thing treated as one tag.

* meaning, only for a bit more, then i'll find somewhere more suitable...
