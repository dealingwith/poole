Today [I rode around for about an hour and a half][1], then I got chased by a
dog, [then I rode home][2]. Was home and out of my kit by 10:08. It was
starting to sprinkle a bit the last mile or so but now it's looking like
another sunny day!? I keep riding because the forecasts call for showers but
those showers have yet to come. Just as well; nature's way of making sure I
get on the bike.

Funny thing about riding 7 out of last 8 days is I ran out of [kit][3]. I had
to wash a pair of [bibs][4] in the sink last night and ran a fan over them all
night to get them dry in time (and they were still a little damp, but only the
lycra on the far side of the chamois ...the chamois itself being the key must-
be-dry element of the thing). I need to remember to get some new bibs soon
(later: um, damn they are expensive!). I have one pair of shorts and two
jerseys I got in the last year. Everything else is over 10 years old. I'm
totally shocked it's still functional.

Anyway, I have an entire load of cycling stuff in the wash at the moment. The
four flights of stairs down to the laundry and back up are a _bitch_.

Now I'm spending too much time in the [UofA Cycling Flickr pool][5]. And
[World Track Championships 2008][6], where [giants ride bikes really fast][7]
and [Britain][8] has been kicking a lot of tail.
