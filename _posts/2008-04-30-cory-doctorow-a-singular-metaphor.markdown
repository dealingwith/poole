I finally got around to subscribing to [Cory Doctorow][1]'s podcast a couple
weeks ago, and today while [running around][2] I had a chance to finish up his
spectacular talk from late last year, [A Singular Metaphor (direct mp3
link)][3]. Highly recommended. [I tweeted a][4] [word of the day][5] yesterday
while listening to the first part, but the even better term was [the
Singularity][6], used with nuance in the second half of the talk.
