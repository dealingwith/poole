> You don’t have to work hard to work well. You don’t need sinister eyebrows
or only 4-hour sleeps or a booked calendar to be serious. But somehow that
image sticks so bad that we tend to view fun as the opposite of Serious
Business Stuff(TM).

It’s a false choice, not a real fight. And you accept its premise at your own
peril. Fun is all about creativity, innovation, play, experimentation,
progress, and seeing real things come to life. If you make fun an enemy of
business, you’re judging all these desirable concepts by association.

Having fake fun outlets won’t help either. Goofy Friday outfits or a monthly
karaoke night are not a suitable substitutes for letting fun be a part of
every day work.

So enough with the bashing of fun in business. Instead, go out of your way to
introduce and nourish fun and its friends passion and motivation. That crew is
the true silver bullet in the new world order.

from the comments:

> “During the Renaissance, when everything, including life itself, was
subjected to analysis, life itself was disassembled into what were considered
fundamental but independent activities: work, play, learning, and inspiration.

Institutions were created in which each activity could be carried out
independently. Factories were designed for work, not play, learning, or
inspiration. Theaters and arenas were designed for play, not work, learning,
or inspiration. Schools were designed for learning, not work, play, or
inspiration. Museums and churches were designed to provide inspiration, not
for work, play, or learning.

However, the transformation to systemic thinking has brought with it a growing
awareness of the fact that the effectiveness with which any of these
activities can be carried out depends on the extent to which they are
integrated. Therefore, it has become apparent that a transformational leader
must be able to integrate the various aspects of life in order to effectively
pursue development. The transformational leader is one who can create an
organization that reunifies life, who integrates work, play, learning, and
inspiration.”
