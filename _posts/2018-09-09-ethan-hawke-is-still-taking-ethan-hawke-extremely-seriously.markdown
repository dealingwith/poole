I actually never knew he was so scorned by critics. He just happened to star in a bunch of my favorite movies: _Dead Poets Society_, _Before Sunrise_, _Gattaca_, _Great Expectations_...I even liked his novel _The Hottest State_. He's one of the few Gen X actors that Gen X grew up with.

> Mr. Hawke found that so moving, the idea of ignoring what the world was telling you about yourself and instead living only by standards that you had, yourself, carefully defined for your life and work. He vowed right then that he would do whatever it took to make good art on his own terms, no matter what anyone said. He would take himself seriously, even if no one else did.
