This data is pretty typical; in fact it is actually not bad considering how many meetings I was a part of this last week.

Slack is almost always the winner, which is a little bit sad. I am usually ok about email; my recent strategy is to not open it when I first arrive at the office (although I will have checked it on my phone before leaving the house). Then I open it after I either complete an important work task; or when I'm doing [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), as the 2nd or 3rd pomodoro of the day. Last week I installed [Quitter](https://marco.org/apps) by Marco Arment and assigned email to quit after 15 minutes of inactivity. That also helps with email interruptions. (I practice [inbox zero](http://www.43folders.com/izero), natch; but that is a different post.)
