BTW, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308644/">Finding Neverland</a> is a REALLY good movie, if you can ignore the fact that Johnny Depp has eyeliner tattooed on. It may have been the timing, it might have been something specific to me, but I have never cried so much in a film before. It was really great. My beard was all wet and snotty by the end of the damn thing. Started halfway through and then pretty much nonstop for the last 1/4.



Blogging shall be light. Lots to do. I wasn't too upset about the two weeks when this site was essentially down. The <a href="index.php?cat=12_Days">12 Days</a> thing will have to just continue when I have time. Maybe I'll rename the category, maybe I'll realize that this entire blog is about finding out my values, goals, dreams, etc.
