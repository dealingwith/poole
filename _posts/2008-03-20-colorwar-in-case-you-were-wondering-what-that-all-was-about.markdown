[zefrank.com: colorwar 2008][1]:

> There are dozens of teams, some of which are hundreds of players deep. _Many
of the players don't really know what they joined or why_, but for me and the
wonderful coders that are working on this, it is a perfect implicit structure
that can be used to start setting up the colorwar events. And beyond this, it
is an idiom that can be used to create rapid affiliation and action models in
the future.

Emphasis mine. I'm posting this here mostly for future reference and because
of the statement I put in _<em>_, which is what I found most interesting about
yesterday's color team phenom.

"[the future is text][2]"

From the comments:

> Think about relationships: the closest seem to live in a constant fuzziness
of how that "love" or "commitment" can be defined, yet you don't doubt it
exists. But the relationship between me and my boss? Clear, defined... and
very limited. Depth brings diffusion by definition.

> The information is not on the words: it is in our collective memory...the
constraints words place on communication force writers to innovate and probe
the depths of the mental process of reading in order to communicate more than
the meaning of words.
