Because you see, GS is more than just the good son. He's the good citizen.

He pays his rent on the last day of the month before it's due. He tips 20%. He goes to the porn shop with tall bushes around the parking lot so people can't perchance see his car in the parking lot of a porn shop.

Because he's the GC.

So no GC would get involved with a jewel heist.</font>
