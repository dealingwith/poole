> A DemoCamp is a lighter-weight style of un-conference. A DemoCamp lasts only
a few hours on a weekday evening. Unlike a BarCamp, you don't have to present.
You are welcome to come along and give feedback to the people who do (or just
watch and absorb if you don't feel like talking). Demos should have roughly a
2 minute introduction, 8 minute demonstration, and 5 minutes for questions. 15
minutes total. There are 5 presentation slots available.

So basically these unconferences are about the most fun a geek can have with
his or her clothes on. MY goal is to get some non-geeks to start going to
these, get some multi-disciplinary cross-pollination going on, Integration
Research style. But it appears my ideas for such are still unpalatable. Even
though everyone jokes about the nerds being the rich, successful ones in real
life, we're all still a little scared they're gonna bust some quantum whoop
ass super soaker on us should we get too close.

So now that I've practically dared you to, who wants to drive up to the
northern climes with me for [DemoCamp][3]?
