[Christo, Artist Who Wrapped and Festooned on an Epic Scale, Dies at 84](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/arts/christo-dead.html)

> Again and again, Christo prevailed, through persistence, charm and a childlike belief that eventually everyone would see things the way he did.

> "For me esthetics is everything involved in the process---the workers, the politics, the negotiations, the construction difficulty, the dealings with hundreds of people," he told The New York Times in 1972. “The whole process becomes an esthetic---that’s what I’m interested in, discovering the process. I put myself in dialogue with other people."

> When New York’s parks commissioner at the time, Gordon J. Davis, rejected “The Gates” in 1981, setting forth his reasons in a book-length document, Christo simply incorporated the rebuff into the project. “I find it very inspiring in a way that is like abstract poetry,” he told the College Art Association. “He adds a dimension to the work, no matter what he thinks.”

...

> The next year [1962] Christo staged a brilliant coup de theatre, a work he called “Iron Curtain: Wall of Oil Barrels.” As part of a solo show at the Galerie J in Paris, he blocked off the narrow Rue Visconti for several hours with 204 stacked oil barrels, while his wife kept the police away through a series of diversionary tactics.

...

> Several projects on a grand scale followed in the 1970s. For “Valley Curtain” he strung orange nylon fabric along steel cables over a narrow pass in Rifle, Colo.; a large semicircular opening allowed cars on the state highway below to pass through.

> Fierce winds ripped the curtain to shreds two days later, a setback that Christo shrugged off. “I as an artist have done what I set out to do,” he said. “That the curtain no longer exists only makes it more interesting.”
