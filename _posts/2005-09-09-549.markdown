_Snowball can't be blamed, or even subtly criticized, as the people of New
Orleans were subtly criticized for being both poor and mostly black--as if
these factors had made them responsible for the flood. A dog just yaps, pants,
loves, and eats. A dog has no interest in the efficiency of Mike Brown, head
of FEMA, or in the political hay to be made of the failure in New Orleans. The
dog's equation is simple: if the little boy is not here, who will bring me
biscuits? Also, will I be eaten?

That's why it's so easy to empathize with Snowball's bafflement in the face of
something so terrible. This mess has been conflated with so many other things,
coming as it does when the country has come unmoored and is floating
perilously close to the edge of the world. Snowball puts it back into simple,
animal terms and makes it possible for me to grasp a little of what it's like
in New Orleans._
