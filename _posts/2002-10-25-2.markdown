<i>Elsewhere:</i> <b>Home Recording</b>

This morning on NPR I heard the last segment of <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/2002/technopop/index.html#stories">NPR : TechnoPop: The Secret History of Technology and Popular Music</a>. Very good stuff! Gonna check out all the prior segments one of these days. Pretty much described where I'm at/coming from when it comes to the music world. Major articles and commentary on distribution blah blah blah forthcoming. I'm having major brain farts on how to actually bring about that elusive and obtuse new economy I've had on my heart for a while.

Now if I just had all kinds of free time to record! :P
