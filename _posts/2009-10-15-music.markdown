[Presteign][1], randomly found site, love the overall aesthetic. Music-group-
as-corporate-entity is not new (see [dfg corporation][2] [#][3]) but I also
like the music-group-as-cultural-ministry, and the above-linked site pulls it
off with a nice, subtle European flair.

Been thinking a lot about what I want/need to do in regards to my artistic
pursuits, having done virtually nothing since the release of [the last
record][4] last March.

Then there's this attitude, equally popular:

> Call it God, magic, fortune or simply the sum of the variables you cannot
understand or control, but know that your very best work cannot be scheduled
of produced on-demand. You’ve got to be patient, you’ve got to try and try
again and you’ve got to let God in.

-- from [Let God In][5].

Coincidentally, I got a new temp site up for [johnnycitizen.com][6], just
conglomerated all the different iterations and content across four different
sites. Still not sure what I'm going to do with it, but since it (and every
site on my server) was hacked earlier in the summer it'd just been empty.

I have a bookmark folder around here somewhere full of great tunes I've found
over the last 6 months, all free for the download. I might be posting another
music post here soon.
