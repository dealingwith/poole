> In 2009, tech investor Paul Graham published an influential essay titled "[Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)." In this piece, he argued that the best types of schedules for people who makes things are different than the best schedules for those who manage things.

> As Graham elaborates:

>> "The manager's schedule is…embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you're doing every hour…"

>> "…But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started."
He then delivers the key conclusion: "When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster."

> Though Graham doesn't mention it specifically in the essay, we might add that the need to keep up with an inbox or chat channel can be equally disastrous to a maker. The constant context switching, [as we now know from research](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il), also prevents the maker's brain from fully engaging the creative task at hand.
