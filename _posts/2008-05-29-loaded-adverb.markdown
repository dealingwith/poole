[Create a GWT project - Google Web Toolkit 1.5][1]

> This means that GWT can seamlessly work with whatever server-side framework
you happen to use, be it PHP, Ruby on Rails, _or even_ ASP.NET.

...emphasis mine. I love how hierarchies are subtly communicated.
Interestingly, Python isn't even on that list, despite being what [Google App
