Today has been a Cold Fusion day (with a tiny bit of JavaScript thrown in, but that never counts). What stikes me odd and what would make me pull my hair out (if it wasn't already falling out by itself) is that what is SO easy in PHP is SO hard in CF and vice versa! If only I could just combine the best parts of both we would have a great server-side scripting language! (I still prefer PHP;  the tag format of CFML is just yuk...I think it was supposed to be easier for peps, but it is really just a mess. BUT I'm get paid for the CF work, which of course makes up for ANYTHING!)
