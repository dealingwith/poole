title: "Fear, Flatulence, Fingers, Fabulous"

Last night hail and tornados fell upon our city, distracting Penn from his homework and generally striking fear into the populace of our metroplex. As the weather man continued to pronounce the imminent destruction of our homes and businesses, Penn expressed multiple times, _"I'm scared!"_ My only response was, "I am too! We all are!" I have a whole post about fear coming up.

When the time came, we closed all the shudders and doors and got into the bathroom located in the very middle of our house. You could barely hear the storm from in there. Then the power goes out. And it gets hot quick.

Then Penn goes, "Wait, I hear something!" We all get quiet. And then he lets rip a loud one! He and I laugh loud. Mom not so much. But I was pleased at how well I've trained him.

Took this video shortly before we retreated to the bathroom. It was _non-stop_ lightning. If you watch the whole clip, you'll see the _huge_ strike that made me stop filming and all of us run back inside!

This morning we went for our second baby appointment and another sonogram. They had to measure the baby's neck or something so to get the baby to get into a position where they could get their measurement the technician had Carissa move around. She moved to her right side: nothing. She moved to her left side and our baby did a little 80's dance. It was certainly a fantastic way to start my day, seeing that.

Also there was the image above, where you can see her/his fingers. Which is awesome/amazing.

Tonight I went to a talk by [Gary Vaynerchuk](http://garyvaynerchuk.com/) who is an amazingly inspiring speaker. During the Q&A he always asked how the question-asker was doing and the question-asker always reciprocated the question. His answer was either _tremendous_ or _fabulous_. It's part of his thing. He's like a ball of infectious energy which I appreciated and enjoyed. Still, it made me think about that question, one we all ask. _"How are you?"_ A question I have an entire blog post about as well.
