<blockquote>Starbucks has nabbed the exclusive first rights to sell "Bob Dylan: Live at the Gaslight 1962," an album of newly restored live recordings culled from Dylan's performances at the New York cafe.

The 10-song CD hits more than 4,400 Starbucks' locations in North America on Aug. 30, and will also be available through its Web site. The exclusivity window lasts 18 months.

Starbucks Entertainment president Ken Lombard says he hopes there are more such projects to come. "Our plans with Bob Dylan go beyond this," he says...</blockquote>

Lombard went on to add that for a limited time Starbucks will be introducing the "Double Tall Dylan Latte," a special blend emulating that served at the Gaslight "back in the day." "The Dylan" will be the regular Starbucks house blend, left on a conventional coffee burner for three hours. Used grinds are mixed into each cup and the drink is topped off with expired milk.

<blockquote>[Starbucks] recently scored a six-week exclusive on a new acoustic version of Alanis Morissette's "Jagged Little Pill"...</blockquote>

The "Morissette Blend", available now, is simply yesterday's leftover coffee. "Thankfully, our stuff is already really bitter," said Lombard.

> U.S. lawmakers who just returned from a tour of the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, expressed satisfaction with the conditions there and the protections of detainees' rights.

> In the wake of reports of detainee abuse at the Guantanamo facility, lawmakers wanted a first hand look at the situation there.

> Members of the House and Senate toured the facility over the past several days, met with U.S. personnel and monitored detainee interrogations. Republicans and Democrats alike returned to the U.S. Capitol Monday satisfied by what they saw.

> "The treatment that is being provided to these detainees is in my opinion probably the most humane, high-quality treatment that any nation that has ever captured detainees at war has ever provided its prisoners," said Senator Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican.

> United Nations human rights investigators recently urged the United States to allow them to inspect the Guantanamo facility, citing what they called persistent and credible reports of allegations of torture and cruel and inhuman treatment of detainees.</blockquote>

from john heron project:

> ...take for example, the passage on the aftermath of the shock Roman defeat by the Goths at Hadrianople [sic], where Gibbon talks about the effect this had on the Roman psyche, leading to vile treatment of Gothic prisoners by the Romans in the name of "homeland security", and compares this to his own age:

> > (How far) the urgent consideration of the public safety... may operate to dissolve the natural obligations of humanity and justice is a doctrine of which I still desire to remain ignorant.

> A sharply divided Supreme Court issued a split decision on the public display of the Ten Commandments on government property Monday, forbidding framed copies on the wall of two rural Kentucky courthouses while approving a 6-foot-tall granite monument on the grounds of the state capitol in Austin, Texas.

The court said that the padded kneelers and Kleenex boxes below the Kentucky Commandments installations indicated...

> ...[the] purpose of favoring monotheistic religion, but the Texas monument, put up in 1961, was a less blatantly religious statement tinged with secular historical and educational meaning as part of a group of similar markers on the grounds.
