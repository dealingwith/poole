>   1. The need for space in NYC isn't about needing a place to build your
business, its about a place to aggregate community and meet other creative
people.

>   2. Real estate is a red herringâ€¦ no one seems to be having a real issue
affording to live here. (Bay Ridge as tech center?)

>   3. There is a serious lack of angel funding, and the expertise and
guidance that comes with it, in NYC.

>   4. Our "heros" have their volume set too low. We need to put a megaphone
in front of the charismatic personalities of NYC and get them out in front of
more people.

>   5. We need to refocus on our natural business advantages. Instead of
having the next nextNY open houses at AOL or IAC, the "tech" companies, we
need to be having them at CBS Interactive, NYT Digital, Digitas, MLB
Interactive and Goldman Sachs.
