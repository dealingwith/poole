Windows users: just stumbled upon [this post w/ link to "Royal Noir" theme for
XP, if you are sick of the XP look and want more shininess][1].

[Also, I installed Firefox 2.0 today and quite like it][2]. Worth the 3
minutes. And you [can add del.icio.us and flickr to the search bar (among many
others)][3]
