Not sure if I'd already blogged this article, but I wanted to capture this
particular quote, even if it was for a second time: [The new UI wars: Why
there’s no Flash on iPhone 2.0][1]:

> This is a company so obsessed with UI and user experience that it hasn’t yet
introduced something as basic as copy and paste on the iPhone 2.0 because, as
is rumored, it hasn’t quite nailed a proper UI pattern.
