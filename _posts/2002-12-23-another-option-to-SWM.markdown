I am trying to build the best of all worlds into SWM...this guy is just trying to combine all the worlds to get the best...whatever works! <a href="http://www.rklau.com/tins/2002/12/23.html#a751">Using Movable Type on a Local PC and Publishing to the Web</a>.



SWM will run on your local machine and you will publish to your webserver with a push of the button (this is what I do already, but I'm willing to put up with all the bugs and by-hand work arounds in this the 0.2 version!)...exactly what this person achieved with all that work and two different products...guess he really likes MT's interface better than Radio's...and I don't blame him--it is better!
