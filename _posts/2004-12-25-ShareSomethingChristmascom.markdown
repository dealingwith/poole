Faced with the binaries of the Great Consumer
Holiday or <a href="http://buynothingchristmas.org/">Buy Nothing Christmas</a>, we try for a
positive alternative, a proposition with action, an
attempt to revitalize the true meaning of Gift.



It just so happened we've been developing some
software with sharing in mind. It's an ethic we'd
like to explore; we wanted a tool to help us; we
created <a href="http://smartcommons.org">Smart Commons</a> and <a href="http://smartcommons.org/Collection/index.html">Smart Commons
Collection</a>. Give them a spin this Christmas, once
the Spin of Christmas has worn off. What else
are you going to do with all that stuff?

Here's the code to throw on yer blog:



<textarea rows="8" cols="50" style="background: #fff;
border: #ddd 1px solid;
font-family: Verdana, serif;
font-size: 10px;
margin: 0;
padding: 3px;" name="select1" >

Smart Commons and Smart Commons Collection are both in the beta stage. They work fine, really. <a href="http://theyblinked.com/blog">Dan</a> has been working his ass off getting this thing ready for release. But he is an army of one, like, for real, not like that other army, so be nice. And look forward to good stuff.
