[Textism: Did you really][1]

> ...there was just something so, ugh, web whatever point whosit class-
conscious about it. I mean, I like Maggie Mason and the stuff she does a lot,
and even she might agree that that ‘just landed in LA’ on the twitter.com
front page has got to be up there among the most unctuously precious things
ever. Hey you, mister startup: please don’t try to sell me your fancy new
gizmo with the same sort of air-quoted, I-didn’t-say-it-you-did fabulousity
with which the dolts at Vanity Fair service the celebrity trade.


You’ll agree that everything deserves a second chance. A few months ago
Twitter started slowly making sense. I’m not sure I concur that, as some have
said, the constraints of 140 characters will force anyone to think or write in
a meaningfully new way, but there’s something attractive about this throwaway
stream of rants, thoughts, links, asides. Fragments of the lives of others
just drift in, make you smile, or wince, or roll your eyes for a second, and
then disappear. Very little offered, nothing expected in return. I can get
behind that...
