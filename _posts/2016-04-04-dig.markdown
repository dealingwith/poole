Recently some friends of Adam Again remastered _Dig_, frequently considered their best work, re-released it on CD and released it for the first time on vinyl. The title track has always been one of my favorite songs. I've covered it many times. 

In fact, my own song _[Don't Tell Me](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/dont-tell-me)_ was directly inspired by _Dig_; and the lyrics in the ending of _Don't Tell Me_ are stolen directly from _Dig_.
