Via ["Making a 10-year-long MacBook owner switch to Pop OS"](https://www.reddit.com/r/pop_os/comments/k1f4nj/making_a_10yearlong_macbook_owner_switch_to_pop_os/) I discovered [this Pop_OS setup guide](https://github.com/themagicalmammal/howtopopbuntu) from which I stole or was inspired to change some things.

First and foremost I finally got PulseEffects equalizer working thanks to their [audio tools](https://github.com/themagicalmammal/howtopopbuntu#audio-tools) section and [this post](https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/pulse-effects-equaliser-not-working-in-20-04lts/21929)! On the Mac, I used [Boom](https://www.globaldelight.com/boom/) and it was towards the top of the list of things I missed. I like this PulseEffects equalizer better.

I installed a few more Gnome extensions but ended up only using _dynamic panel transparency_.

I installed [Starship](https://starship.rs/).

I installed FiraCode Nerd Font via [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and am now using it wherever I use monospaced fonts. Not sure about this one.

I changed my theme up to [Skeuos](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1441725/) as seen in the above screenshots.
