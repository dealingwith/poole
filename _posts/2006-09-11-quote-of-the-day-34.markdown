> A very lovely witch, a woman who taught me a great deal, assured me that
Yoda had it all wrong. It isn't a matter of "Do or do not; there is no try."
"Try" is, in fact, all there is. We are defined not by our successes, but by
our endeavors. Success is the reward for some endeavors - it's the carrot
that's held before us. We think our goal is to get the carrot, but in striving
for the carrot, we're actually moving the cart, man.

oh and hell, here's what i said:

> what he said.

also, in my most grandmotherly welsh voice (i don't even know what a welsh
grandmother sounds like to begin with, mind you): Well, _I_ think your writing
is just _marvelous_, dear.

i mean, it's why i know you....because it was good enough for me to be like,
"what the _fuck_ is _this_?!!" and keep reading having NO clue what was going
on -- i mean how it was all presentened not the writing of each bit (sorry)
piece (?). and then keep reading and keep reading and, well shit, i don't even
remember how we first got in touch but then there we were meeting IRL. crazy
crazy crazy.

self publish. web. vainity press. i know, i know, you're a _snob_ and all. you
want a proper book in proper hardback with a proper publisher's name on the
spine. with proper unattended book signings and miserable royalties that make
you feel like a failure even though there's like 20 blogs devoted to your
book.

or like i said, you could put it out there in the world anyway, _sans_ old-
skool media's false shite, and enjoy the 20 blogs devoted to your work
anyway...with less stress...

i talk big even though i've died this death of which you speak a thousand
times. and maybe it's only because, hell, i'd be happy just to have someone to
share some _time_ with, let alone a life or procreative goodness... maslow's
little pyramid and all. i am a cog, and although i grind through every day, i
enjoy what i can, even if that's a ping and a cigarette and some guitars on
the porch down the way...

...a _pint_. a _pint_ and a cigarette. although pings are good too.
