Alcazar was on the German music video station we got in Sarajevo approx every 10 minutes while I was there in 2003. I've expressed my affection for eurotrash dance music before in this forum (I would go find the post but it's not quite worth it). [Alcazar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcazar_%28band%29) epitomizes everything that is wonderful about the genre. The cheese is so thick and yet so entirely unironic...and well, hell, it's just catchy, sexy, uberdancible, _fun_ music. It's not a record to buy, but the videos are like a beautifully orchestrated train wreck, and on the dance floor there are no odd breaks or fauxartistic tangents to deal with...just hip-grinding goodness. What puts Alcazar at the top, though, is the thoroughly sexy yet very oddly androgenous personae. The supergay guys and the porn-star women, sugar coating bad myspace sexuality so we can watch it every 10 minutes on music television and morning talk shows.

Anyway, this video personifies all of this. I do hope you'll find yourself fully rubbernecked and checking out other Alcazar videos on YouTube. Try "Start the Fire."
