We have spent the whole day rearranging furniture and otherwise getting settled in our new place.



Anyhoo...I will post pictures of our place after all is settled, in a week or two...our place is actually really great, way better than we expected and honestly nicer than any place we've lived before.

The food here tastes so good. We came at the right time--fresh fruits and vegetables galore...only what is in season...and then there is the bread...and the no-dairy thing? That went out the window pretty much the first day. We are back to eating cheese and yogurt. They do have soy milk here, which is good.
