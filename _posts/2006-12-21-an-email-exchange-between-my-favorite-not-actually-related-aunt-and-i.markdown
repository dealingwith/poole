"Are you experiencing the joy of this season, remembering Jesus' birth?"

"I wouldn't call it joy, but I have had some fleeting happiness and a lot of
creative output this season. Another Advent focused on waiting, except the
things I am waiting for won't be birthed on Christmas. On cold nights in dirty
places under inauspicious circumstances, yes. But not by this weekend.

"How's that for vague?"

"Vague??? There must be a better word!"
