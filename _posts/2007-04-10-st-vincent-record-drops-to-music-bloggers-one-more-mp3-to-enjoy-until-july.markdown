> Put simply, Marry Me is even better than we had hoped. The LP, which
features contributions from David Bowie pianist Mike Garson and assorted
members of Annie's other band, is not only one of the most strikingly bold,
self-assured, and ambitious debuts we've heard in forever, it's also one of
the best records that will be released this year. And while it's definitely
important to note Clark's obvious technical prowess and gift for crafting
stunning, elaborately-arranged pop songs like "Marry Me" or "The Apocalypse
Song" or the incomparable "Landmines" (wow), those aren't necessarily the
things that make Marry Me so wonderful. The time Annie put into fashioning
every moment of every composition into exactly what she envisioned is evident,
and nearly every risk she takes on Marry Me pays off, giving the songs the
kind of timeless feel that allows the album to transcend the "outstanding
indie record" tag and venture into "unclassifiable instant classic" territory.
