[Here's all the Washed Out I found on the internet plus one I bought from
Amazon][3].

(Per request, I'll post more mp3's in the near future.) (As always the files
themselves will not live on my server for long, so grab them now.) (I have a
lot of plans for the site(s) and having to post my images on Flickr is not
part of those plans.)
