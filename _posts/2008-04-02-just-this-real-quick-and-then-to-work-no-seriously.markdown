[this was really what I was thinking as I moved my mouse down over the
computer's clock to see what day it was][1].

regarding [the post about art][2], I'm just saying, when you get into a
pseudo-argument with the person you spend about 80% of your time with about
the idea of people who "are not in it for the money" hanging their art up on
every street corner and putting price tags on it and how there's something
wrong about that, and you use a phrase like, "[conforming] to the
capitalist-'artistic' process" and they have _no_ idea what you're talking
about...you have a long way to go before you effectively communicate what the
crap you are talking about. Hence the "1-12" month mark for this polemic I'm
writing in my head.

and that's the easy, possibly-achievable part of the equation. [the other
part][3]? i'm not even sure if it's possible...

my art is having a _huge_ midlife crisis. no. let's call it a [dark night of
the (artistic) soul][4].

in any case, it is frustrating. i now have better words for [this uneasy
feeling][5] i've been having for years, maybe most of the chapters written,
but none of the chapters have their wrap up paragraph, those words that make
you agree with what you've read even if you were entirely unagreeable for the
entire chapter, and allow you to move on with any amount of comfort that what
you're consuming is worth precious neurological transactions.

and anyway, i have a [_fucking record out_][6], FFS.
