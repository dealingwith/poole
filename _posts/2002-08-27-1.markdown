didn't get to the computer yesterday despite it being an odd day of bits and pieces, just so many i never had a change to get to the internet cafe until it was too late and they had closed for the festival...one of the problems with my procrastination habit...

i again have no time as i'm on someone else's dialup and don't want to abuse it...

the festival was really amazing, beautiful, full of stories and meaning. i will continue in the next week or so to give much better glimpses into some of my experiences there, as i process them myself and get contemplative and shit...
