[Trope][1] (em tags added)

> sketching a mental picture of the essayist as a scruffy _fucksimper_ who
suffers from chronic index-finger-swelling brought on by speed-dialing through
all the music he shat onto his 500G jizz-hued iPod. After he gmails his
guilty-pleasure opus to his editbot, who will rewrite it into a _charticle_,
he heads to the bar to meet a friend and pulls the pod from his pocket. “Bro,”
he says to the friend, “you'll never believe how much Devendra Banhart I have
on this thing. All of the Devendra in the world.” He touches the cool white
control disc, swirling his finger teasingly, and his friend nods wide-eyed at
the flashing list of songs—until finally they reach the end of the Devendra
listing and wander into Devo, and then, consumed, they run to the bathroom and
passionately tug each other's beards—"rejoicing in the hands," it's
called—until they both reach mutual, musical ecstasy and cry out from the
sweetness.
