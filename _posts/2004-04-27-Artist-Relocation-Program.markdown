<blockquote>Paducah, Kentucky wants artists. And they'll help you move there if you are one. Paducah's Artist Relocation Program has exerted the same magnetic pull on others who've dreamed of living, working and, most importantly, owning in a neighborhood of like-minded residents. In 2 1/2 years, nearly 40 people have moved here to transform a beat-up area of homes known as Lower Town into a blossoming art colony.</blockquote>
