[Michael Lopp on Twitter][1]:

> The act of one human being choosing to follow another is a big deal. As long
as nefarious intent is not in play, the connection creates what the social
science nerds like to call an affinity map; by drawing a line between you and
me, we can infer that we’re somehow connected. How are we connected? Who
knows? Maybe you like nerd culture? How about gel pens? We’re not really going
to know until we test that link by asking a question.


...I’m eagerly watching Twitter evolve and organize itself. I’m dazzled as
third parties are giving Twitter memory and context. But what I care about,
and what has value to me, is the tribe of people in my ecosystem. Twitter is
the best social network out there;, it’s a great social search engine;, and
it’s a short strategic hop from being a terrific next generation address book.


My tribe is not your tribe because you’re not using Twitter how I do. You
wrote an Academy Award winning screenplay, only follow a few people, but have
thousands following you. You sell shoes and follow each of the thousands of
people who follow you. You are a major airline, but sound surprisingly human.


Twitter’s value has nothing to do with the technology.
