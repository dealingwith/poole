>If completed, it would contain every possible combination of 1,312,000 characters, including lower case letters, space, comma, and period. Thus, it would contain every book that ever has been written, and every book that ever could be - including every play, every song, every scientific paper, every legal decision, every constitution, every piece of scripture, and so on. At present it contains all possible pages of 3200 characters, about 10^4677 books.

Try the search functionality! For example, [here is the next paragraph of this blog post in the library](https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?ldmbvgernibaj,g,jnzufz289).
