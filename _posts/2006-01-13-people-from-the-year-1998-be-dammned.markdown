_A few weeks ago I thought that I might try out 1280 x 960. 1024 wasn't really
doing my 19" any justice and I thought that if I cranked it up I might
actually be able to design a full web page in Photoshop without having to
squeeze between palettes and grope at scrollbars.

Boy, was it luxurious -- way more content on screen, smoother edges, and
plenty more squinting. But after I'd put out my first design at super-res and
looked at it on another system, I had to swap back. Why? Because there was too
much freedom for me. With so much space available -- particularly in my
browser -- it was too tempting to use it, and people from the year 1998 be
dammned!_
