Normally I try to link to more obscure things, but these two stuck out as blog-worthy blogs:

Anil Dash's [12 Things Everyone Should Understand About Tech](https://medium.com/humane-tech/12-things-everyone-should-understand-about-tech-d158f5a26411):

> Tech is more important than ever, deeply affecting culture, politics and society. Given all the time we spend with our gadgets and apps, itâ€™s essential to understand the principles that determine how tech affects our lives.

And Jason Kottke's [Blogging is most certainly not dead](https://kottke.org/18/04/blogging-is-most-certainly-not-dead), a list of interesting blogs. So meta.
