[Twitterlesung][1]. ...I like when a somewhat disruptive technology that
almost revels in its place as a mediation (or, in Twitter marketing speak, a
"communications utility"), spills into the real world. We are no longer tribal
by geography, so our tools help us be tribal despite geography (and attention
constraints). But we still need to gather around the campfire and re-tell.
It's again all about narrative.
