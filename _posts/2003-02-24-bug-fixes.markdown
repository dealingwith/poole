Just fixed two bugs in this code...nobody point those out or anything. ;) Permalinks work again, again...they are slippery little things, those...



Update: 13.00 ...Fixed yet another bug. <s>Pages with "more words" display a bit differently (but at least they display at all now), I think I'm going to go with it even though</s> I could easily change it back with one more line of code.
