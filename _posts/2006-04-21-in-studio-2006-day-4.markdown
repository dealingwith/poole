Last Saturday i was in the studio again...

[Black Eyed Kinda Love][1]

Me: Guitar, Drums, Percussion, Vocal Salim: Bass, Keys, BU Vocals

This is the last song I wrote, in December 2004. Before the lifeforce-sucking
2005 experience. I've just recently started to write again. Some ideas, etc.
Can't wait to officially end this drought.
