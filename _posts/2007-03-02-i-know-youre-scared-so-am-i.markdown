[Andy Zipf - So am I][1]

I think I've posted Andy Zipf demos before, but for some reason this song was
required this morning. This is off of one of his proper records.

Here's one from his previous life (that's all I'm going to say about it):
[Circadian Rhythm - Ever My Love][2]

I'm about to leave for a pretty exciting job interview. My first real
interview with [the new resum√©][3]. They'll either love it or it will go over
like a ton of bricks. Or both; I'm meeting with a lot of people. My mantra: I
don't _need_ this job, I don't _need_ this job.
