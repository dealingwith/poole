I asked Dillen what other bike-related sights I should see and he recommended [Golden Pliers](https://www.goldenpliers.com/), so I went there next.

I mostly window-shopped, although I had a cortado while I was there, and bought some postcards and stickers.

Aside: at this point I had had a large americano at Case Study, two cups of Ethiopian yrgichaffe at Pine State, a Turkish coffee at Nicholas, a cup of coffee at Breadwinner, and now a cortado at Golden Pliers. My nervous system put me on high alert.

That night I'd been invited to my coworker's house in Beaverton for game night. We played [Power Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Grid) and it was a fun four hours. I'd never played a single tabletop game for four hours before. At some point during our constant conversation, my childhood love for the game [Go For It!](http://thetangential.com/2014/04/27/go-for-it-the-most-quintessentially-80s-board-game-ever-made/) came up (although it took me a ton of googling to find it). I described it as my childhood consumerist training, similar to the role that Instagram plays in the lives of our youth in the present day.

>Go For It! unapologetically celebrates the acquisition of status symbols. The winner of the game is the first player to acquire the requisite number of expensive consumer items, each represented by a card with an illustration of the item and a prominent price tag.
