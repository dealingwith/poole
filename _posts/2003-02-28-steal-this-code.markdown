I've been hard on Blogger on this blog in the past, but the fact remains that I still use Blogger for <a href="http://sevenmagazine.org">seven</a>, <a href="/miriam">miriam</a>, and <a href="http://christianpornmachine.com">cpm</a>. Not that I want to use it, but the fact that I still am speaks to something besides just inertia.



Anyway, today I decided I wanted a SWM bookmarklet. So I copied Blogger's, tweaked it a tad, created an abridged create form from the current SWM standard one, and <em>wala</em>, I have a bookmarklet. Thank you Blogger.



Tsunami of link posts forthcoming.



Update: Don't get mad at Blogger when your bookmarklet doesn't work. I understand now. Still, I must say mine seems to be working much better than Blogger's ever did!
