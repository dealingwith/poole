It's all that you do that carries you through And the power that you recieve
destroys you So you take little guns and you zap 'em Cause all you ever wanted
was the truth It's always the same when you walk and you breathe You walk into
me You walk and you blink When you walk into me Get out of town said the man
to the crowd My doppler radar predicts a breeze of long hands So I'm not just
hanging around while they laugh about it I got places to be and the sky's the
limit No more bowling on arrows for me Cause all you ever wanted was glue It's
always the same when you walk in the rain You walk and complain Your socks
have no name so you stop the parade No more walking today
