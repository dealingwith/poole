fear.

the demon of murder comes to feed all the dark spirits with fear. 

fear grips a city and pushes out all other affects. it brings you to a halt. it keeps your mind far away from the quiet and the peace. 

your fear of losing love pushes you away from Love. Love seems so far away. Love, You can't be close enough. You could show up in this room and hold me in your arms all afternoon and I'm not sure that would be enough. 

did you know that during the siege of Sarajevo, it was popular sport with many europeans to join the serbians in the hills above the city and shoot at the bosnians running from building to building?

The hills around the city were filled with a wide range of heavy and light arms. Sarajevans were constantly exposed to sniper fire and shelling -- on the street, at school, in the park, at home, in the hospital, at houses of worship. You had to accept the fact that you were, at any time, being watched and controlled and that you might be vulnerable to sniper fire. And if you as a reader are to gain a grasp of the experience, you must try to see from this perspective and apply your feeling.</i> <a href="http://www.honco.net/archive/990403.html">more...</a>
