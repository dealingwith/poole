![][1]WTF. [Google Code][2] is the same as [SourceForge][3]? So I can't create
a project in GC because I already have it in SourceForge? Or? It is so
confusing and there is no one out there that seems to have a handle on it!

[all these links seem to indicate it is a sep service][4]

[FAQ: Why are you releasing code through Sourceforge?][5] still doesn't really
provide any clarity about how to get a project on GC, espesh if you already
have one on SF

[a search of the code discussion group also turns up nuthin'][6]

few seconds laters: just went to SF. the interface gives me hives. good lord.

much later: ARG! SF fucked up my password. I'm locked out until a volunteer
admin helps me out. I also made the mistake of getting on MySpace. The site is
the most offensive web application in the world. Its popularity boggles the
mind more than how GW got re-elected prez.

so I've been two the two worst web apps in the world this morning. I feel like
I need to shower.
