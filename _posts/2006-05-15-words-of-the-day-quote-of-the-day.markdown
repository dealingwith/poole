[oenophile][1]

[inveigle][2]

obscurantism

[cognoscenti][3]

_Now that I think about it, there must have been a jungle, a mountain range of
[externalities][4], currently obscured and invisible to me, that involved this
object. That growing and fermenting of grapes... topsoil loss, tractor
exhaust, chemical fertilizer, insecticide sprays, the fuels involved in
heating and distilling all that liquid... I'm not supposed to worry my pretty
head about any of that, but you know something? I know that I am paying for it
somehow. Those phenomena do impinge on me; legal, social, ethical,
environmental, all of them. They're not pretty, and neither am I. They should
inform my decision about whether I buy that bottle and integrate its contents
into my body._

(all via 4 pages of [Shaping Things][5]. you can tell i ate lunch solo for the
first time in a long time, because i once again was able to return to this
always-carried-in-my-work-bookbag* tome after a long absence.)

*loved the excuse to use this word
