I'm actually really glad I don't have to try and explain this to you. <a href="http://ellensjourney.org/stranger/archives/000588.html">Great recap of a very weird Euro music thing I can't really explain</a>.



<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/archives/004745.html">Beh H also waxed a tad on the contest</a>.



<strong>Update update:</strong> <a href="http://www.missmonica.org/2003_05_01_archive.html#200338503">This is a great recap by Wood</a>. Except the UK got nil because they were absolute crap; the worst; torture, really; it wasn't political.
