<a href="http://oblomovka.com/entries/2002/12/19#1040323800">This one</a> is really interesting. As is <a href="http://www.bpjtv.org/video/index.cfm?videodoc=intro&clipname=ktvu_ins">this video (realplayer)</a> linked to within. 
Being the husband of an immigrant, and knowing many immigrants, these stories hit close to home. 
Honestly, I feel like the people saying we have to sacrifice the ideals of this country in order to have a <i>sense</i> 
of security, are really just the most selfish, fear-driven, media-brainwashed people around.
