<s>If you go to <a href="http://www.iuma.com/">IUMA</a> and search for my old band, "hope against hope", you will find two</s> [<b>Update:</b> I just changed my "band name" so this probly won't happen now anyway.]...NEEDLESS TO SAY mine was the first.



Now, I don't mind, coincidence and all that, except for two things: they are from Orlando--oddly close to where I performed AS hope against hope, and they are on IUMA. That means when they signed up they SURELY saw that there was already a "hope against hope". I wonder what they were thinking? "WE were the first!" "WE'LL get signed and let the lawyers take care of it!" "WHO cares?" "WE capitalize H, A, and H!"



OH I see they have <a href="http://www.hopeagainsthope.com/">hopeagainsthope.com</a>. Well good for them. I wonder if they waited tooth and nail (ha that was the worst pun ever) as I let that one expire a year and a half ago.



Grrr...ok I'm over it. "Get over it." I'm over it. :)
