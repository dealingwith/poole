The title is both un- and ironic. The subject matter is perfection. The
execution is in a deeply flawed, human manner. My versions of the songs are
warbled, misqueued, stumbled around. Even the graphic has a typo.


For a while now I've been meaning to record myself live. I finally have the
setup and the other day just plugged in and played the first four songs that
came to mind.


The single track that is these four songs off my home recorder is meant to be
listened to once and discarded. The included original versions of the covered
songs are meant to be enjoyed and pondered.


So enjoy and ponder.
