<a href="http://alexandershideaway.org/">Christopher Williams at Alexanders Hideaway Saturday night</a>. Not only do <a href="http://www.christopherw.com/">Christopher</a> and I have the same godmother, but he is an amazing artist. <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/blog/index.php?file=2002_11_18_new.xml&id=11">I went to see him in VA in 2002</a>. If you still need persuading, <a href="http://pastemusic.com/radio/mp3/ChristopherWilliams-TreadLight.mp3">CW - Live - TreadLight</a>, <a href="http://pastemusic.com/radio/mp3/ChristopherWilliams-EveryTimeISayGoodbye.mp3">Every Time I Say Goodbye</a>, <a href="http://pastemusic.com/radio/mp3/ChristopherWilliams-TheseDays.mp3">These Days</a>, all from <a href="http://pastemusic.com/artists.asp?t=artist&search=christopher&browse=">pastemusic.com's page for CW</a>.



Please get in touch with me by tomorrow afternoon if you are interested--I'm getting tickets then, and can reserve a table if I have enough RSVP's.
