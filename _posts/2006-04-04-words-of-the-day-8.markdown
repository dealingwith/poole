minutic* 'my-new-shick' _adj_ "myspace users provide all the minutic details
of their existence"

exaggerance _n_ "he does his work without undue exaggerance"

* taking recommendations on the spelling. but 'minuteaic' or 'minutiaic' would
add a syllable i don't want. of course the proper term is simply 'minute', the
root for 'minutia'. i love circular word creation.
