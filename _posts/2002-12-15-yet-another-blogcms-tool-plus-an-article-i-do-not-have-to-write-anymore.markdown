Just stumbled across a peer of mine, who of course is a little further ahead of me, but hey, no worries, abundance mentality and all that pop-psych stuff.

Anyway, check out <a class="dead">this article (dead link)</a> on how the blog paradigm is taking over the old-school/bubble CMS paradigm...it is right on with my thinking of the last 6 months or so. Then you can check out his blogging software to see what you think...I'm about to do the same...still waiting for that one piece of software that makes me say "Ok, it's been done, let's just all use this..." but it hasn't happened yet...we'll see what this Crimson thing looks like. (Coop should like it anyway since it's got the maple leaf as a logo.)
