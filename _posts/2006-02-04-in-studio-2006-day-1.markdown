For you loyal readers who have kept tabs on me through this last year, here
you go:

[Sucker for Love][1] by Daniel Miller ...until about an hour ago still
stubbornly titled "You Don't Have to Make a Sound" after lyrics long since not
included in the tune. More lyrics were removed today. This is a rough mix. It
is pre-mix, really. Still plenty of time to keep working on it.

Vocal, Acoustic Guitar, Drums, Tamborine: Daniel Miller Bass, Vocals: Salim
Nourallah Electric Guitars, Organ: [John Lefler][2]

Produced and engineered by [Salim Nourallah][3]

_Hey baby, sorry for my circumstances Sometimes you gotta take your chances
The only constant thing in life is change I'm just a pacifist at the shooting
range

I am a sucker for love like a peacenik with a white dove I don't just want
someone else to shove but I'm old enough to know when it fits like a glove

Let the future take care for itself Keep the best books up on your shelf A
good story never gets sick of being read We'll have plenty of time for regrets
after we're dead_
