For you loyal readers who have kept tabs on me through this last year, here you go:

[Sucker for Love](https://danielmiller.bandcamp.com/track/sucker-for-love) by Daniel Miller ...until about an hour ago still stubbornly titled "You Don't Have to Make a Sound" after lyrics long since not included in the tune. More lyrics were removed today.

Vocal, Acoustic Guitar, Drums, Tamborine: Daniel Miller. Bass, Vocals: Salim Nourallah. Electric Guitars, Organ: John Lefler

Produced and engineered by Salim Nourallah.

> Hey baby, sorry for my circumstances 
> Sometimes you gotta take your chances
> The only constant thing in life is change 
> I'm just a pacifist at the shooting range

> I'm a sucker, a sucker for love 
> like a peacenik with a white dove 
> I don't just want someone else to shove
> but I'm old enough to know when it fits like a glove

> Let the future take care for itself 
> Keep the best books up on your shelf 
> A good story never gets sick of being read 
> We'll have plenty of time for regrets after we're dead
