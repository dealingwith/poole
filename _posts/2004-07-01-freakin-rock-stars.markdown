In "Old Weird America," the title of which is taken from Greil Marcus' book about Bob Dylan, Gentry writes, "The people on the ground/Won't react to a sound/Until it's right above them/It's easy to fool the dead/It's easy to give them head/And not really love them."</blockquote>I've got the whole thing saved and will probably archive it here once it's off the City Link site.
