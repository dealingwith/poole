I figured it was as good a proving ground as any for my always-reading-the-
spoken-word-stuff-at-gigs theory. The first piece I read was [this one][1] and
when I'm done with any given vignette I throw the paper on the ground. Some
guy picked it up.

Towards the end of the set I was heckled.

"Play some goddamn hits!"

"Did someone just say 'Play some goddamn hits?'"

"FREEBIRD!"

"How original. I'm sure there's a cover band playing somewhere on this street.
But I'm afraid the Freakin' Hott won't be playing any cover tunes you know
either. Unless you're cool."

Play a song. Then, to Maggie in particular, "Now I'm going to really blow
their minds. I'm going to READ to them."

After my set a woman came up to me and asked me to sign the paper with that
first story on it. I was kinda shocked. I signed an illegible "Daniel Miller"
and said, "My name's not really Johnny Citizen." She said, "Really?" rather
sarcastically. I didn't give her a URL or anything. I need management.

And a band. All serious offers fielded. This is going to be Johnny's year. We
hope.
