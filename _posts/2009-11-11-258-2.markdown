> You can try to win a features arms race by offering everything under the
sun. Or you can just focus on a couple of things and do ‘em really well and
get people who really love those things to love your product. For little guys,
that’s a smarter route.


When you choose that path, you get clarity. Everything is simpler. It’s
simpler to explain your product. It’s simpler for people to understand. It’s
simpler to change it. It’s simpler to maintain it. It’s simpler to start using
it. The ingredients are simpler. The packaging is simpler. Supporting it is
simpler. The manual is simpler. Figuring out your message is simpler. And most
importantly, succeeding is simpler.
