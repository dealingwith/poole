> Our snails are equipped with a miniaturised electronic circuit and antenna
that enables them to be assigned messages from hardware located within their
enclosure. The moment you click 'send' your message will travel at the speed
of light to our snail server where it will await collection by a snail agent.


Once associated with the tiny electronic chip on the snails shell your message
will be carried around until the snail chances by the drop off point. Hardware
located at this point collects the message from the snail and forwards it to
its final destination.

[The worlds first webmail service using real snails][1] from
[boredomresearch][2]. There's even [a blog][3].
