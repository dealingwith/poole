[The Joy of JOYity: Bringing “Massive Multiplayer Trans-Reality” Games To
Android Phones][1]

> When you download the app you can play one of three games (YouCatch, Roads
of San Francisco, City Race Munich) or design your own. In Roads of San
Francisco, for instance, you have to go around the city picking up clues. When
you get to a destination, a text or picture message tells you where to go
next. It is a Scavenger Hunt with a story line. You can also design your own
Scavenger Hunt games and play them with large groups of people.


Another game that comes with JOYity, YouCatch, is a version of Manhunt.
Players in the same city sign up for a game. Everyone acts as both hunter and
hunted at the same time. The game assigns you a player that you are hunting,
while assigning you to someone else as a victim. Everyone’s location is
periodically flashed on the map. When you get within 25 feet of your victim,
you press the scrollball on the phone for the kill. But every time you press
the button, your location is shown to all the other players as well. The last
person standing wins.
