which unfortunately also equates to how I feel both mentally and physically.
i've got an annoying cold, the kind that doesn't knock you out so much that
you _can't_ do anything, but enough so much that you don't _want_ to do
anything. i did manage to move a piano--_to my house_--this morning and am
going to a show tonight, but inbetween-times? not so much. i miss someone to
talk with, someone to lay around with. someone in particular.

[Duke Special - John Lennon Love][1], from [the free EP you can download
here][2].

[Olospo - You Deserve Better][3] from the [Zac Crain benefit CD][4]. i've been
really into this song lately and emailed Chris Holt about getting ahold of
more Olospo. he gave me the scoop on the band which I put on [his last.fm
page][5].
