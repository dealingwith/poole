Feeling lonely, sleepless, tired, melancholy, sober and nostalgic for days more filled with artistic pursuits. Bill Mallonee is always good company for these moments. Probably the most well-kept secret in the American songbook, Bill has been writing and recording music for over 24 years, and most of it is exceptional. He's also dug more than a few ruts into the road, touring as a matter of course throughout his career. I had the honor of playing the same stage as he during the 2003 [Greenbelt](https://www.greenbelt.org.uk/) festival (he had a much better draw).
