[![DSC_0082][1]][2]So I bought this piece of art. I thought I was going to
have a lot to say about it. But. I bought it, an impulse buy that lasted a few
weeks. Most I've ever spent on art. I'm really happy I got it. Art is so
fucking cool.

I did another one of those spoken word things. [Wal-mart==Heaven][3],
originally [here][4]. Once again crank the mids. It's so weird: when I do
songs on my little home recorder, the vocals are too up front. Spoken word is
the opposite.

I think I'm going to go on an online hiatus. Only big stuff. I'm about to
enter a strange and solitary time. I can feel it like a wave offshore,
imperceptively big against the horizon, not yet breaking. A swell. I'm really
curious what that wave is going to wash ashore.

_If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the
work, and give orders. Teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea._
