[ART CON 08 00][3]

Originally uploaded by [dealingwith][4]

My piece for [Art Conspiracy 4][5]. I've described it as "[horribly, horribly
ironic][6]," which it is. [Pete Rollins recently wrote a simple, brilliant
definition of irony][7]:

> Irony as a political stance can be described as a way in which we
intellectually disavow our social activity. For instance, often individuals
host 70’s or 80’s parties in which people dress up in the fashion of the time
and dance to the most extreme and laughable music of the era. Here people are
able to laugh at the music and the outfits while dancing to the music and
wearing the clothes. Thus they are able to ridicule the very activity that
they are fully engaged in...

Hopefully, the irony in the text of the piece itself is obvious--if you
haven't figured it out yet, [try the large size][8].


But there is an irony in the event that I am also attempting to critique, and
I'm going to discuss it for the first time here, hopefully briefly and of
course with a significant disclaimer at the end...

[Much time passes and he further loses motivation...not to mention has to
leave to attend said event! Yet to be continued!*]

* Never mind. The more I thought about how to write about it, the more multi-
threaded it became and every thread required a damn disclaimer. Art Con is a
fine event. I secretly want a version that is more like an art rave than an
art bazaar, but since I'm certainly not going to organize anything anytime
soon, I'm just going to STFU.
