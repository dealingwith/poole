I haven't been able to follow the Tour as closely as I would like the last
week due to work constraints, a trip over the weekend, and preparing for my
gig tomorrow night. But Floyd Landis lost the yellow jersey by a lot today.
I'm sure you can google it or go to http://velonews.com to check out the
details.

I've liked Floyd since I found out he had made it into the pro peleton some
years ago. He grew up in Lancaster, just down the road from me, racing many of
the same races I did (but in much higher categories).

But if you want to know the main reason I've like Floyd so much, especially
since he took yellow in this year's tour, just [watch his response to
questions about his bad day today][1].

I've recently had two conversations about how bike racing culture is elitist
and rude. It wasn't always that way, in fact I noticed the trend myself
towards the end of my "career" in 1996/1997. I remember the early days (for
me, the early 90's) of camaraderie, deep friendships, and a focus on the
aesthetic and serendipity of riding a bicycle.

To me, and this is just MHO, Lance represented more of the former. Floyd
embodies the latter. That makes me happy. I'm not at all sure it's total
coincidence that I've gotten back on the bike the year after Lance retired,
and that [messenger culture is making a comeback][2] too.
