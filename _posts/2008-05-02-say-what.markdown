[say WHAT??][3]

Originally uploaded by [_rebekka][4]

Given [sugarfilled][5]'s recent rejections from iStockphoto ("too much post"
on a photo straight out of the camera), the fact that someone stole 80% of
their iStockphoto portfolio off of someone else's Flickr account--
photoshopping the watermark off of a 300kb image already compressed by open
source server side scripting code on Flickr's servers--REALLY PISSES ME OFF.


To the point I think I'm going to use up the rest of my iStock credits and
find a new stock image supplier.


This is the other far side from [this thing][6] and pisses me off far, far
more.
