<a href="images/ch.gif"><img src="images/ch1.jpg" border="1" align="left"></a>last night i had this really bizzare dream. i'd forgotten about it all day but it just came back to me. u wonder about my voice "against" the church, well this is the kind of shit floating around my subconscious. i was at some "festival" in the US. a "christian" festival. <a href="http://jonnybaker.blogspot.com">jonny baker</a> was in my dream, speaking at this thing...or something...(my dreams are always vague)...anyway, it was something funny, a satire of some kind. except some middle-aged WASP couple had taken exception to our satire and was drilling me, rebuking me, chasing me into the amazingly piss-smelling bathroom and beating me with their soft-sided shoulder-slung lunch coolers (vague, right?). i ended up saying "shit" or "fuck" or something and then all hell broke loose. i think i woke up at this point.

just so u can have some PO reference here, it seems Greenbelt, Soularize, Burning Man, Jim and Tammy Baker, Jonny (UK) Baker, the old couple from the end of Mulholland Drive, the <s>people</s> fundie-evans bashing me on the <a href="http://www.next-wave.org">Next-Wave</a> board all combined to make for a really funky dream. fortunately i'll forget it by tomorrow....

which all reminds me of a note i took at random in the middle of
