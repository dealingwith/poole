I hope you realize these are in completely random order.



Tito & Tarantula concert, Sarajevo, July 2003.



Not much to say besides: see this band live at all costs. To say it was the most rocking concert I've been to all year would be accurate; and those 2 hours were like being back in the States for a short, beautiful, artistic moment in time.

Is it mandatory for all band websites to be entirely Flash-based or something? Screw it, then.
