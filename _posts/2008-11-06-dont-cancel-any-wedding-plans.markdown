From [a certain goat's blog][1]:

> Also, as I commented on her post: "the other thing to remember is that
xenophobic ballot measures are just a weird fluke of california politics
designed to rile up the idiots during years when they'd otherwise not bother
voting, and that just like always -- remember prop 187? let's deny education
to the children of illegals? hey, think of all the problems that'll solve! --
the cali supreme court will quietly knock it down six months later as the
unconstitutional nonsense it is."

Don't cancel any wedding plans.
