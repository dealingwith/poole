So I was in 7-11, the one behind Publix on Hillborough and Federal Highway,
the other night, and, like, normally I am like Thank heaven seven eleven, and
recently this REALLY nice Mexican guy started working there, like WAY too nice
for a 7-11 employee, but anyway it's quite nice actually.

So I'm getting beer, and I pull the first six-pack out of the fridge and it's
missing a bottle! (The NERVE of some people!) So I don't see any other six
packs of that brand at first, and then I see another one behind a six pack of
a different brand. Already a pain in the ass!

Then I pull THAT six pack out and it is ALSO missing a bottle! OMG WTF?! So I
am managing three six packs and trying to get a complete six in my brand
there, and as I'm putting one of the six's away it pushes some of the six's
from the next row over and they go tumbling off the back of the shelf there.
There was this huge sound of bottles breaking and I was like, Oh shit and
looked around...then this Indian woman comes out the back like PISSED and
screams at me and makes me go look at the huge pond of beer accumulating in
the back room and says Who's going to pay for this? about three or four times.
I just said Sorry and thought Not me!

I felt bad for the nice Mexican guy because she made him clean it up, after I
paid for my six.

Now it's all pretty funny. HA!
