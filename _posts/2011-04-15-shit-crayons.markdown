[Ian Bogost makes a scathing critique of social games][2]:

> Several years ago, Chaim Gingold gave us the useful concept of the Magic
Crayon. A magic crayon is a tool that facilitates creativity in a way that
wouldn't otherwise be possible. A magic crayon lets its users breathe life
into things.

> Some would like to think that all crayons are magic ones. That just any old
thing can conjure. But that's not true. The magic crayon has a shadow side.

> Some barriers are benign, but others are insidious...

> Inspirations like that are not magic crayons, but shit crayons...

> Even if creativity comes from constraint, there's constraint and there's
incarceration. A despot in a sorcerer's hat does not deserve praise for
inciting desperate resilience.
