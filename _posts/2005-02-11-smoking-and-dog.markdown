yesterday was a disaster; i don't even want to record it.

today i'm on my fourth at 3.33 here, inside.

but i ran around with the dog this afternoon, doing a _tiny_ bit of
freerunning or whatever it was called, trying to get him to jump over stuff
and whatnot (no luck there really). later i had the thought that i actually
_wanted_ to work out, feeling a little soreness in my legs from the jumping;
took me back to my _actually in shape_ days, that great feeling of sore
muscles and some extra hormones floating about the bloodstream.

the dog went to the vet yesterday and got some medicine for his GI infection,
and wasn't allowed to eat yesterday. poor dude is starving; i'm only giving
him a tiny bit of food at a time today. he found an old nasty piece of bread
at the park and even after i led him away from it a long way, when i let him
off the leash he ran all the way back there to have at it again, even though
he knew he was going to get hit for it (he paused a couple times when i yelled
'no', he knows that means if he continues he gets hit, he's at least learned
that much, and thought about it, i could see him thinking 'it's so worth
getting hit for!'). i had to run to catch up to him and lead him all the way
out of the park, and no i didn't hit him. poor starving dude!
