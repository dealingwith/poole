[I'm Not Moving On][2] ...by ...me ...

because...well...this is a day of starting to move on. don't know how long it
will take, how successful we shall be, or if we'll even survive it. but this
song shall not be played again. the phone numbers are deleted, the bookmarks
too. the photographs are burned to a cdr and put on the bottom of the stack.
certain cd's shant be played. they might even be traded in. it's sad. it's the
loss of something beautiful. but this is life. we've done this before. and
maybe, just maybe, we'll be blessed with something as beautiful again someday.

i've got that intense urge to move again. we've felt this before. but we feel
like we've run all over the globe trying to find _that place_ ..."home"... all
we want is to go home, but we don't have one.

_We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition,
when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on
making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer
of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased._ -- Lewis Carroll
