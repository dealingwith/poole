"Christianity started out in Palestine as a fellowship. Then it moved to Greece and became a philosophy, then it went to Rome and became an institution, and then it went to Europe and became a government. Finally it came to America where we made it an enterprise." :: Richard Halverson via <a href="http://myvalentine.blogspot.com">myvalentine</a> and very similar to my thing from My New Church pt 2, which is still not up because <a href="http://monkhouse.blogspot.com">Hopkins</a> <i>is being creative now, jeesh</i> :) <i>creative people, now why don't those slakers do something important like interpret scriptures literally</i>
