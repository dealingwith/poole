David <a href="http://monkhouse.blogspot.com/2004_08_01_monkhouse_archive.html#109250852577188000">mused</a>:<blockquote>Do the sum total of one's interests and hobbies equate to an "identity?" Maybe not twenty years ago. But now, our interests and hobbies have become much more sophiscated and nuanced--with magazines, role models, mass consumption, 24 hour media, communal and solitary expressions. These interests become linked to our fashion sense, our values, and perspective. We no longer identify; we advertise our identity.</blockquote>

From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/026263287X/qid=1092634395/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-9126044-0387335?v=glance&s=books">rhythm science</a> by <a href="http://www.danielsjourney.com/blog/index.php?file=2003_01_06.xml&id=150">paul miller</a>:<img src="http://mitpress.mit.edu/images/products/books/026263287X-f33.jpg" alt="" align="right" /><blockquote>The term "vector" comes from geometry and refers to a line of fixed length and direction but no fixed position. Consider the way ideas move through our minds and bodies. There is no fixed position. There's only the improvisational nature of recall. Thought vector: the relationship between a geometry and a geography of information...by extension, one could think more abstractly of a vector as a relation between a determinate and an indeterminate property...



The idiot as processing device, slave to the moment, outside of time because for him there is only the moment of thought. No past, no present, no future. The idiot is a zombie, a character straight out of <em>Thriller</em>, one of Michael Jackson's chorus line of decaying bodies moving into y'all's neighborhood. Watch the idiots dance to rhythms they do not feel or understand...The person without qualities who cannot say "I." The person whom others speak through, who has no central identity save what he or she knows...



Roam the interstices of globalization as a ghost in the machine as we fast-forward past the middle passage and into the hyperlinks of a database culture whose archives routed and dissolved into almost every format of memory...Plastic, fluid memories run into circuitry and focus our attention on a world where we download ourselves daily. This is a word game of the nonconscious...



There's always more than one map to the territory: You just have to intuit the terrain...Unpack the meanings, unstuff the fragments and the logic remains the same: the part speaks for the whole, the whole is an extension of the part...But what happens when the memories filter through the machines we use to process culture and become software--a constantly updated, always turbulent terrain more powerful than the machine through which it runs?</blockquote>

I just finished hanging <a href="http://www.integrationresearch.org/gallery/archives/2004/08/daniel_miller_artifacts.html">my work</a> for this weekend's show. As I sat down at the computer, daunted by the amount of work I have yet to do, eyes completely bloodshot, Bob Dylan's <a href="http://bobdylan.com/songs/hattie.html">Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll</a> was playing on the stereo.

<hr />
<small>William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll

With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger

At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'.

And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him

As they rode him in custody down to the station

And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder.

But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,

Take the rag away from your face.

Now ain't the time for your tears.



William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years

Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres

With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him

And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,

Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders

And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling,

In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking.

But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,

Take the rag away from your face.

Now ain't the time for your tears.



Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen.

She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children

Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage

And never sat once at the head of the table

And didn't even talk to the people at the table

Who just cleaned up all the food from the table

And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,

Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane

That sailed through the air and came down through the room,

Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle.

And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger.

But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,

Take the rag away from your face.

Now ain't the time for your tears.



In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel

To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level

And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded

And that even the nobles get properly handled

Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em

And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,

Stared at the person who killed for no reason

Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'.

And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,

And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance,

William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence.

Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,

Bury the rag deep in your face

For now's the time for your tears.</small><hr />


I don't know what I'm trying to say with this post either. You may live an honest life. You may intentionally tell complete lies to manipulate others for your means (all the while accusing others of being compulsive liars--beware! the compulsive liar accuser).



You may allow your mind, and more importantly your heart, the winding trails it desires to skip upon. You may seek comfort and priviledge above all things.



To the latter in either case (and they seem to cohabitate nicely), all I can say is: I'm sorry for you and yours, and may you be on your way.



The the former in either (and they do seem to go hand in hand), all I can say is: Yay.
