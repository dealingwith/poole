I want to help. My heart cries out. But do not manipulate me. Just tell me what you need, besides this earth to be something entirely different than what it is, and I will try my best. I wish I could just write my own reality too, but I can't. We can only roll with the punches, coming as often as they may. Just don't punch me.
