## The Worms

The only thing greater than the number of text/code editors in the world are the number of developer opinions about them. There is the classic [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)/[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) debate. There are constant comments about the languishing of the popular [Textmate](http://macromates.com/) (and pigs-have-flown exclamations at its recent 2.0 release). There are so many editors and development environments, in fact, that I must stop mentioning them now or risk a never ending paragraph burdened with commas.

## Pop-top

At [Extra Sauce](http://extrasauce.com/) we are not only platform agnostic (we pick the best stack on a project-by-project basis, although we have some tendencies) but we are tool agnostic. Within the development team we are split between Emacs, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/). 

We are all happy with our different tools for various reasons. So I ask this almost entirely due to simple curiosity: which editor do *you* use? Leave your reply wherever...we'll see it.
