I've recently started reading a bit more than I had been in the last few years--due in no small part to having taken over kids' bedtime duty--and have focused on fiction for the first time in a long time. It's refreshing and really helps my mind work better.

As always, however, I read at least a handful of books at the same time. This is less to do with attention span or any given book and more to do with the absurd amount of material I consider essential to consume given my various interests and the multitude of things asked of my expertise. 

Recently finished:

* [A Spell for Chameleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Spell_for_Chameleon), [The Source of Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Source_of_Magic), [Castle Roogna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Roogna) and [Centaur Aisle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur_Aisle), the first four novels of the [Xanth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanth) series. I read a number of Xanth novels in junior and high school, but I can't remember which anymore. I didn't start at the beginning back then, that much I know, so starting there was nice. I eat these things up. They can be a little crude at times (in a Mad Men kind of way), but the plot speed, universe and vocabulary lessons are all great.

* [Traction: Get a Grip on Your Business](https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Get-Grip-Your-Business/dp/1936661837) (for work).

* [Jagged Alliance 2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22886428-jagged-alliance-2) by [Darius Kazemi](http://tinysubversions.com/) (check out his [2014 XOXO Festival talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_F9jxsfGCw)). This book is great because it's not just about a video game, it's about the making of a video game. 

Started but not planning to finish:

* [Rising Strong](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23317538-rising-strong). Seemed like good stuff, definitely some quotable bits, but it became a slog I can only describe with, "Meh."

Started but probably not going to finish:

* [Playing at the World](http://www.unreason.com/) is a great history of [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons). It is also very, very, very, very, very detailed.

Currently reading:

* [Make Something Up: Stories You Can't Unread](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822857-make-something-up) by Chuck Palahniuk. Historically I have been a huge Palahniuk fan. _Survivor_ and _Invisible Monsters_ are two of my favorite books. But in the last decade, I've lost my taste for his particular brand of shock-horror. Still, there were a couple really good short stories in this collection. I just can't recommend it because of the chances of triggering for anyone. I am now looking for the equivalent but for the middle-aged parent set. 

* [Sword of Shannara](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15575.The_Sword_of_Shannara?ac=1&from_search=true). I read this one in junior high as well. It is very long and a little tedious, but I am taking my time with it. No clue when I will get it done. My goal is to finish it before I dive back into the Xanth series.

* [The No Asshole Rule](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97905.The_No_Asshole_Rule?from_search=true). Read the sample (chapter 1) from Amazon and then got it from the library. So far, it's good. Need to get back into it before it's due!

* [Sprint](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25814544-sprint?ac=1&from_search=true). About the practice of design sprints. I'm fairly familiar with the content of this book, but it's good to get it all in an organized and edited format.

* [Inspired](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3323374-inspired?ac=1&from_search=true). About software product design and development. We're adopting most of the recommendations from this book at work. I'm again familiar with the content but not _as_ familiar as I am with _Sprint_. I am a big fan of the author's many talks on the same subject. Obviously, the book goes into a lot more detail.

* [The Nature of Software Development](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781941222379.do). Kind of what it says on the tin. If I had this in digital instead of hard copy I would be done with it already, as it is a short one. Alas, I do most of my reading in the dark!

Queued:

The queue is impossibly long, but here are a couple in there that I have my eye on:

* [The Letters of Ivor Punch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25248845-the-letters-of-ivor-punch). I've been a fan of Colin MacIntyre's music (aka Mull Historical Society) for a long time. When I found out he'd written a novel I immediately picked it up.

* [Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saga_(comic_book)). I devoured the first two [trades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_paperback_(comics)) when they first came out and have three and four waiting in the wings. I think there are quite a few more than four at this point.

I just looked again at the queue and not only is it very long, it is full of amazing things I really want to read. Sometimes I think that if I were independently wealthy, I would just read all the time...(that's not true)...
