The ~~following~~ are from a slide presentation indended for those interested in the possibility of an online gaming venture, with the future possiblity of creating a piece of desktop software that would help build these non-linear games, as well as influence many markets mentioned within this document. I am not too forthcoming with the specs on the software, however the spec does continue to evolve and is closely linked to the higher level discussion here.

Bottom line for investors or other interested parties: very little upfront investment, great time to market, and great revenue streams. This could never be a multi-million dollar business, but it could be a very interesting buy for a Microsoft, particularly if the software I have in mind were as extensive as I imagine it.
