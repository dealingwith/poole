I've had a ton of blog entries stuck in my head and unable to make their way
into any of my various publishing systems...something about having a baby and
working for a startup. And getting old. But [Carissa][1]'s [take on our brunch
last weekend was perfect][2]:![][3]

> This is time frame in most of my friend's lives where we're all settling
into this world we created. We're settling in to our ideas and our beliefs and
how it's all panning out. We're settling into our mates or what we want out of
a mate and understanding more about what was so totally wrong with that last
boy/girl friend. We're nestled in with sticky-faced children. We pride
ourselves more on our practical functionality and less on our storebought
fronts. We're not so swept away by the masses, trends or media and can focus
on the big and small pictures individually. When we gather around food and
beverage we can connect things from all over and we suddenly need to take care
of one another.
