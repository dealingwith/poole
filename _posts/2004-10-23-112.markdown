> Bush has done a great job of starting wars to keep our troops busy -- 2 and
counting so far, with Iran, Syria and North Korea coming soon to a war theatre
near you! In fact, he's been so successful at starting wars, that we barely
have enough troops to go around, even with the backdoor draft of forcing
reservists to serve longer involuntarily, extending Marine enlistments
involuntarily, and calling back once-retired soldiers to duty, involuntarily.
Bush thinks starting wars is so much fun, he wants to share the excitement of
war with all of us.

The Draft. Think of it as a Bush job creation program. A job offer you can't
refuse.
