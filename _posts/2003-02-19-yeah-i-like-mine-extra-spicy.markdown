I like my hosting company a lot, but while I was looking over their hosting plans again today <a href="http://www.featureprice.com/images/platinum_girl.jpg">this picture</a>, for their <em>platinum plan</em>, left me a little worried--<em>hot chicks work <b>in</b> the server rooms!</em>



<b>Update:</b> just to clarify for the misinterpreting: stuff in italics is almost always quotes on my site, so "hot chicks work in the server rooms" is me putting words in the mouths of the marketing execs, as if we would buy webserver space for the same reasons we buy beer and buffalo wings...which, of course, might be the case...
