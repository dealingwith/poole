[Melodica Festival Self-Indulgent, But Still Positive for Dallas][1],
especially the comments. [This too][2] ESPESH the comments OMGBBQ.

I think the main thing everyone is missing is: damn if this new music editor
isn't a uniter.

Recently revisiting [Immediatism][3] flavors my reading of all this. I was
about to post _iii_ as my comment on the actual article, except it doesn't
make sense unless you automatically replace [Wuffie][4] for _Capital_ like I
did.

> For art, the intervention of Wuffie always signals a further degree of
mediation. To say that art is wuffified is to say that a mediation, or
standing-inbetween, has occurred, & that this betweenness amounts to a split,
& that this split amounts to "alienation."

There is so much in my head around art right now, but it's too disjointed.
Crazy good book coming 2018.
