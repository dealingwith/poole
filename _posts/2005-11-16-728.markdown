>...Also I have stopped reading blogs, all of them, and without exception I am
not participating in the wider community. Which is a lot easier than
forgetting to read some really important post by some really important blogger
and feeling embarrassed about it when trying desperately to pass myself off as
a geek in the know on some mailing list for some conference I was going to
attend but decided not to due to lack of interest but mostly lack of money.
Breathe!

>...I also have an idea brewing, an idea so radical that even the Missus
managed to raise half a bored eyebrow and grunt in my general direction. An
idea so radical that if I told you, I'd have to bore you.. I mean...kill you.
So I need to go away and think about this idea, put it into perspective, work
it through and abandon it due to being 32 and lacking the ambition and drive I
had as a young man.
