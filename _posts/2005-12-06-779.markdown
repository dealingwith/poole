_I'm on a mailing list (several, actually) where musicians across the world
discuss stuff. Today, there was a message from a band that spent the last week
as the "featured artists" on MySpace. They got placement on the front page,
alongside Madonna and the Roots, for a solid week.

One of the band members posted the numbers:

* number of times their music was played: around 20,000 * number of MySpace
friend requests: 1200 * number of mailing list signups: over 100 * number of
CDs sold: ZERO

Yep, a big whopping zero, null, nada, none. No CD sales! They're still waiting
on a report from iTunes, though. The band didn't seem so much upset as curious
-- you'd think after 20K spins, someone would pony up for a CD._
