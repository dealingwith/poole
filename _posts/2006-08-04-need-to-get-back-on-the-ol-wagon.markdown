been drinking way too much again, which leads to silly/stoopid things. like
karaoke [renditions of Hit Me Baby One More Time][1]*

See more progress on: [drink less alcohol][2]


* Although not only do I like me [some][3] [euro][4] [trash][5] [pop][6], but
I like me some [trashy][7] swedish-[american][8] [pop][9] as well...

...don't forget I'm playing at the Gypsy Tea Room (Tea Room side) tonight at
9...opening for The Whigs...
