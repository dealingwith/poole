Just wrote this in my personal blog/journal:


<blockquote>And maybe the high energy people don't come without the bullshit, and maybe the deep people don't come without the melancholy. And that's ok. Maybe they will always be put off by our silence, and maybe we will always laugh under our breath at their ignorance. And that's ok. Maybe they only talk shit and never do anything, maybe we never talk about anything and always make shit (to steal the German phrase). And that's ok.</blockquote>
