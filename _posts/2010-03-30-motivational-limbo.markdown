I'm in that place where everything is tolerable but not yet perfect or
finished, and the list of everything is rather long. Having trouble connecting
this long list of next todos to anything that might motivate me to accomplish
them (funny how much effort a single phone call can take sometimes) or
deciding which of the long list is most important right now. Nor do I have any
tools (software or wetware) to help in this matter.

This, besides the day job, is the problem domain that is consuming me. I've
designed a tool to help; I just need to build it. I need the tool to help
build the tool. Talk about eating one's own dog food.

In the meantime, I'm very curious about others' systems/tools for getting
things done (especially if it's not Getting Things Done, for which there is a
lot of information out there--it does not help with the core issue described
above, it assumes you're already motivated to "turn the widget", or worse,
that turning widgets is motivation enough for humans).
