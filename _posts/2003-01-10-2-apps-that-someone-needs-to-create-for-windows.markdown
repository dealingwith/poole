There are 2 apps that are so obvious, and <i>have</i> been very <i>poorly</i> made so many times; and someone needs to create <i>simple</i> versions of them that <i>work</i>: a download manager and an xml editor. If you know of any, contact me. Remember, must: simple, work. For some reason these two, in specific, tend not to go together!?
