My grandfather died today. I'll be quiet about other matters for a while.

![][1]

Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable
inherit the imperishable. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed.
The trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be
changed. When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the
mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true:
"Death has been swallowed up in victory."

Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord,
because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. Many prophets and
kings wished to see the things which you have seen, and did not see them, and
to hear the things which you have heard, and did not hear them.
