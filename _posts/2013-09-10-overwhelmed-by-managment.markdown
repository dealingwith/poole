![Shelf of things](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5535/9720057139_84e1ae7284_z.jpg "I'm not sure what this photo has to do with this post, but I like it. It's a shelf in my late grandfather's shop. He was one of those people who really did seem to have everything together")

Somehow in the last 9-10 months I've gone from managing (seemingly) almost nothing to managing (seemingly) _everything_. This had made me feel very old. Like somehow one hits some age where one looks around and realizes _no one is in control here_ and instead of continuing about one's life one _takes control_. And it all feels very overwhelming. I am now in a job with more responsibility (which, yea!), part (most?) of which is managing (three! just three people! it's _so_ much of my time). I manage the family finances. I plan and execute vacations. I am producing and releasing a record (_way_ more work--when you're doing it entirely on your own--than most people realize). I am managing a Minecraft server for a handful of 9 year old boys (which, _OMFG!_). I organize a _weekly bike ride_ from a _Facebook group_ that I'm trying to form into a _proper road bicycle club_. I'd like to actually _blog_ more than once a month! My [read later](http://www.instapaper.com/) queue, for goodness sake.

This could go on for a while. With increasing levels of disbelief, frustration and rage.

And not only the things I'm directly involved in. Carissa manages the children--a whole pile of different things from "basic" (ha!) care-taking to schedules to meals to sport team logistics to doctor appointments--as well as her photography career and volunteering and her list also goes on and on.

The point being it's all a little overwhelming and just staying on top of [capturing](https://www.google.com/search?q=ubiquitous%20capture) everything that needs done is hard enough, let alone keeping up the energy to keep chipping away at the list! My _really good days_ are those where I feel like everything has at least been captured, that I'm not forgetting some major thing that is going to mess up everything that _is_ on a list. That I haven't missed some deadline that is going to cost my family a lot of money or drama or _even more_ time.

Like they say, _there has to be a better way!_ But...is there? Do those people I see in fancy online videos really have _their_ shit _that_ together? Do my friends with no children, no mortgage, no _significant_ other understand the _embarrassment of riches_ they enjoy in terms of their own time, attention and opportunities? The older and more experienced I get the more I understand the answer to that question is _no they definitely do not_. I certainly didn't. 

And in there lies the rub. _Loneliness_ takes its toll as well. It can precipitate many bad, time-consuming choices. _Too many_ opportunities, or at least the ability to take them, spreads one too thin, and often one does a multitude of mediocre things.

Sure there are the exceptions we all aspire to be. The _overachievers_. But I bet they have their _thing_ too, either now or in the future. And we just don't know about it yet.

Lucy remains amazing. I've missed so much in terms of documenting said amazingness on this blog. But she plays the drums, holds impromptu dance parties, is affectionate, opinionated, demanding and just so darn cute no one can even stand it, and I keep double checking my own prejudice against 3rd party exclamations of the same!
