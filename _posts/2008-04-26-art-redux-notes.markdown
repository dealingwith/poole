The "[big long post about art][5]" is going to end up being the usual bunch-
of-only-somewhat-coherent thoughts here _possibly_ followed by the combination
of all those thoughts into some kind of publication.


But for now, my just-barely-too-long-or-numerous-for-[twitter][6] thoughts...


So much of art these days just seems like improper masturbation to me. I don't
want to become the curmudgeon or cynic that so heartlessly dismissed/dismisses
my own efforts. And I think I differ in that instead of not caring about art,
I care about art _too much_. But seriously, _have you read an artist's
statement lately_? Especially from someone either coming out of an academic
situation or trying to appeal to the academics? It feels like the academies
have slowly become degraded. A _vocabulary representing meaning_ has replaced
_actual meaningfulness_. The words that were supposed to communicate meaning
have become more important than the meaning itself. And without the actual
meaningfulness we lose context. And without context we become vapid. We become
an un-unified theory of everything.


_There is no language without deceit_.


The same could be said for _any discipline_. I guess I just care the most
about art, because art was supposed to be spiritual. _The best Immediatist
agitprop will leave no trace at all, except in the souls of those who are
**changed** by it_ (more [Bey][7]). But it's not enough to just say, "All art
should be Immediatist," because while better than ejaculating on the wall and
calling up your PR firm, that is not what I am proposing. Bey says, "The
game's payoff lies in its ability to escape the paradoxes & contradictions of
the commercial art world (including literature, etc.), in which all liberatory
gestures seem to end up as mere **representations** & hence betrayals of
themselves," emphasis mine, and if you know anything about immediatism you
know he means representations of the immediate, the real, the actual, the pre-
capitalist, the pre-structural. But I mean to say _representations of
meaning_. Just as many Christians have come to [worship the text][8] instead
of the God who presumably authored it, we will continue to make attempts at
words that will give authority to what essentially amounts to some vaguely
aesthetic abstraction of our desires.

Examples will come when I figure out a way to give them without totally
shitting on their parades.
