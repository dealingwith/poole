Last night we went to see the famous Slovak opera singer Peter Dvorsky. <a href="http://www.danielsjourney.com/miriam/2003_02_01_archives.html#88627883">Miriam has the full report and pictures with the star himself</a>. What she doesn't tell you is how smooth we both were going backstage to say hi to him. I'm quite sure it was her looks. ;)
