[Aw, it was nothing][1].

On Friday night at dinner I think all the chemicals fired in my brain by
pulling off the surprise finally settled on synapses and combined with the
alcohol to give me the best high I've had since this insane runner's high I
got once halfway through a 90 mile ride in 1994 or so.
