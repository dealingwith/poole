I'm about to finish my third Newcastle. Just had an entire package of edamame.
Have one cigarette left. I'm home alone on a Friday night.

I have an extreme urge to kiss a woman. As long as she's a good kisser.

I guess that last bit is going to have to wait.


I also have to replace a dog-destroyed shower curtain (it was in need of
replacement already, I'm just glad I didn't replace it just before he destoyed
it) and assemble a dog kennel.


I'm shocked, SHOCKED, that rue10 has only [kissed two][1] people. Somehow that
just seems like a crime against humanity. ;)
