[ArsGeek - Got a band but can't afford to shoot a video? Use public CCTV
cameras and then demand the footage!][1]

> The Get Out Clause are an upcoming UK band who are currently unsigned. They
took a brilliant and I'm sure soon to be much copied method to producing their
own video. Unable to hire a production crew for a standard 1980â€™s era MTV
music video, they performed their music in front of 80 of the 13 million CCTV
"security" cameras available in England, including one on a bus.

They then used Britain's Data Protection Act to request the footage that was
shot of them. Grab some decent and inexpensive video editing tools (say. . .
an iMac) and presto! They got themselves a unique and in my opinion quite
interesting music video.

Apparently the Frames (aka That Guy From Once) did a very similar thing a
while back:
