> So I went back to my notes from the All Nations courses: anthropology,
sociology of religion, folk religion, and it became clear to me. You're not
going to like this, but I've come to believe it's true: The situation only
makes sense if you consider a separate entity called "American Christianity"
which is an **entirely** separate religion to Christianity. Not a branch of
Christianity, not a form of Christianity, but something with absolutely no
connection to Christianity at all. It's a separate religion. And what is the
goal of this religion?

Go for it; look at it phenomenologically, look at it sociologically, and what
do you see? Basically a syncretic folk religion, based primarily on American
nationalism, an expression of the "pervasive religious dimension of American
political life". (Bellah; see also "Civil Religion in America") Its purposes
are basically civil and political. Its morality is taken from a highly
selective and individualistic reading of the Old Testament, and it mixes in
bits of consumerism, Zionism, Republican political values, and corporatism for
good measure. Add to this an almost romantic sentimentality concerning the
person of Jesus, much like the contribution of Catholicism to Vodou religions,
and suddenly it all makes sense.
