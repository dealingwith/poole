I have ignored the magazine Fast Company since about halfway through the dotcom era because of their horrible ethics and completely inauthentic writing...

...but surfed over to their site via <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/">Russell Beattie</a> because of <a href="http://images.fastcompany.com/images/cov66.jpg">the most recent cover</a> (the picture depicts how I feel sometimes). Here's the deal, I like what this person is saying, but there are two things: it is so fucking obvious I'm shocked people need to be reminded of this, that people don't automatically live their lives this way--but the fact is that they DON'T; and two: it's still couched under the mantra of more money--the incredible (ly unbelievable) Starbucks sales pitch, "We're authentic, if you come to our store you'll be authentic." Of course. This is Fast Company.



<i>...business success in the future starts with the question, What should I do with my life? Yes, that's right. The most obvious and universal question on our plates as human beings is the most urgent and pragmatic approach to sustainable success in our organizations. People...thrive by focusing on the question of who they really are -- and connecting that to work that they truly love...Companies don't grow because they represent a particular sector or adopt the latest management approach. They win because they engage the hearts and minds of individuals who are dedicated to answering that life question. 



This is not a new idea. But it may be the most powerfully pressing one ever to be disrespected by the corporate world.</i> [<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/66/mylife.html">the story</a>]
