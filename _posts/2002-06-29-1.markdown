Was just catching up on my blog reading here in the ol' "business center" and found <a href="http://monkhouse.org/david/weblog/blogger.html">these major props!</a> Wow! 

David, shall we <i>blogroll</i>? Ha ha! Sick-O!

Also, upon actually re-reading the last post I realized it should have been "silhouettes him/herself or if <i>he/she</i> just didn't care." I apologize! :)
