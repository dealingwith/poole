Upon entering [Breadwinner Cycles](https://breadwinnercycles.com/) on Saturday I began taking pictures.

The single person in the shop approached and welcomed me, said it was ok for me to be taking pictures, and offered me a cup of coffee. He had an Irish accent that, combined with his hospitality, put me at ease. His name is Dillen Maurer and he's actually with [Sugar Wheel Works](https://sugarwheelworks.com/).

He let me talk quite a bit and answered all my questions politely. He showed me all around the shop. He dug through t-shirt and hat bins for me to find shirts and hats that fit me.

It wouldn't be until Monday that I would learn about Dillen's incredible story...
