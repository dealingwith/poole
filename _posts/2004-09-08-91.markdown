> POPLAR BLUFF, Mo. (Reuters) - President Bush offered an unexpected reason on
Monday for cracking down on frivolous medical lawsuits: "Too many OB-GYNs
aren't able to practice their love with women all across this country." The
Republican president, long known for verbal and grammatical lapses, included
the anecdote about obstetrician gynecologists in his stump speech attacking
Democratic presidential rival Sen. John Kerry and his running mate, Sen. John
Edwards, a former trial lawyer.

At a rally of cheering supporters in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, Bush made his
usual pitch for limiting "frivolous lawsuits" that he said drive up the cost
of health care and run doctors out of business.

But then he added, "We've got an issue in America. Too many good docs are
getting out of business. Too many OB-GYNs aren't able to practice their love
with women all across this country."

Unfazed, Bush went on to deride his rivals as "pro-trial lawyer," and
concluded, "I think you've got to make a choice. My opponent made his choice,
and he put him on the ticket. I made my choice. I'm for medical liability
reform now."
