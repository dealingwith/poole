[DCist Interview: John Vanderslice][1]

[a house in the suburbs of Tokyo where every room of the house is a seperate
building][2] _Flung over the entire site, the boxes form a little community
unto themselves. The spaces between the boxes and the street edge take on a
public/private role as community gardens ...and places of interaction between
the client and thier lodgers.

So the house has becomes like a microcosm of a city; complete with towers,
streets and park_
