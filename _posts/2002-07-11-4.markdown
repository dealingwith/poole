hung out with other FSO students tonight at a happy hour at a pretty cool, unique bar. it was really great. these people have all traveled all over the world, many have advanced degrees, it is really an amazing group with many great stories to share. we laughed so hard at so many stories from India, Armenia, Georgia, Latvia...even somebody who had great advice on how to get inroads into the fiction publishing world...
