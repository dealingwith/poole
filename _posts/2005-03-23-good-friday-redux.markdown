I invite you to my home on Friday, March 25, 2005 at 11:00pm for a "midnight mass" consisting of one simple event: the listening to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000005J1C/qid=1111615349/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-3988949-7479309">Gorecki's 3rd Symphony</a>.



Celebrate the death of Christ, the death of my 20's, or whatever else you might want to mourn and/or dwell in while being soothed by Henryk's "Sorrowful Songs." The event will take about an hour and will consist of nothing else, in fact my wish is for you to arrive empty handed and with few words and to leave similarly. I'm going it either way; hope to have your company.
