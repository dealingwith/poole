The band [I briefly played drums for][3]. Just checked up on them and #1 THEY
HAVE A RECORD COMING OUT! (finally!) #2 [their blog is one of the best][4] #3
they still link to me off their links page! w00t! #4 the particular recording
I wanted for today's mp3 of the day isn't yet available (I thought about
getting in touch and seeing if I could score the album on mp3 etc, but you
know what kids? this is just a blog), so [go listen to this shit, mofo!][5]
good stuff.
