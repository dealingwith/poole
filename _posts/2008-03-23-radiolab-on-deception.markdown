[WNYC - Radiolab: Deception (February 29, 2008)][1]

> We look at lies, liars, and lie catchers, and ask: can you lead a life
without deception? We consult a cast of characters, from pathological liarsto
lying snakes to drunken psychiatrists, to try and understand the dark trait of
deception.

Anyone who knows about the events of my 2005 will understand how interesting I
found this particular Radiolab (Radiolab almost always gives me a brain buzz
but this one in particular hit home).

Salon to discuss deceit with the Rutgers evolutionary biologist][2].
