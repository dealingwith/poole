[~4 o r t y 2 w o~ . . . Capabilities & Approach][1]

> At 42 Entertainment, we help our clients bring their brand and product
message to consumers through immersive, entertainment-based alternative
marketing campaigns.


Our aim is to carve the client's world into today's cultural landscape, so
that, like Middle Earth or Hogwarts, it becomes a priority destination for the
American imagination.


We tell our stories in the form of 'search operas' -- narratives that spill
off the page, the screen, the web, the phone--and into peoples' lives. We
don't send an advertising message into the maelstrom of other competing
messages: we reverse-engineer the process, so that the consumer comes looking
for our campaign and our client's product. We create communities passionately
committed to spending not just their money but their imaginations in the
worlds we represent.

Ok, what I find really interesting is that I was thinking toolset and
obviously a lot of people were thinking marketing/design firm. I wonder what
[Hugh][2] would think of these co's.
