[Smashing Magazine: Beautiful And Original Product Designs][1]

> Successful product design manages to reveal useful functionality beyond its
appealing form. No matter how excellent a design looks like, most customers
aren’t likely to spend money on something they won’t be able to use. On the
other hand, most people are likely to buy something useful despite the design
it has.


Yet the key to a truly successful product design lies in designer’s ability to
combine both beautiful design and functionality making it obvious to the
customers how the product can be used and which benefits it delivers. However,
one can combine the beauty of design with the utility it is supposed to
provide.


Most products fail to pass this test and never reach the production stage;
some products do manage to get to the stores. In the overview below you’ll
find an overview of some beautiful and original product designs which will
hopefully make the cut and will be available in the next years. Some of them
are already available today.

[I have to find some time to check these out in more detail myself, but some
very interesting interfaces here...][1]
