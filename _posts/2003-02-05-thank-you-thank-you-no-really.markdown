I just fixed the bug (nothing on your end) that had left me frustrated enough to park actual coding for a couple weeks (a couple weeks ago) (major architecture reconsiderations, finally getting around to testing more of the numerous other major blogging apps, and getting really sick not withstanding). Grr! :) It was one line, something I forgot to stick in a function way back when. :P It's always like that.
