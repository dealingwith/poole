Story building software is what really stinks. The GUI's stink, they're bound
my story methodologies that are old, old, old, and they're expensive to boot.
Most of these are for screenwriters, and therefore would be used in
conjunction with the storyboarding software. My software would combine these
into one easy to use interface. It's intuitive, allows for levels of
organization from just getting started free associating down to the smallest
detail of the story, and then would assist in creating the output necessary
for any media (screenplay, prose, online presentation, etc.).
