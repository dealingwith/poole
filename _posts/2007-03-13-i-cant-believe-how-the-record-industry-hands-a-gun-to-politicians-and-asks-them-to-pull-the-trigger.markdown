[RIAA's new royalty rates will kill online radio][1]

> The Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) has recently released a revised fee
schedule for internet radio. Left unchanged, these rates will end internet
radio, period. The RIAA has effectively convinced this federal committee to
establish rates that make online radio a non-viable business.

[Doc Searls article][3]

> For most operators, this rate looks as if it would be >150-200% of total
revenues

> the AOL Radio Network [statistics] suggests that AOL played about 2.1
billion songs that month. At the CRB's royalty rate ($0.0008 per play), I'm
guessing that would create a royalty obligation to SoundExchange for the month
of November of about $1.65 million. Annualized, that's about $20 million for
2006.

Here at RAIN, we're guessing that Pandora has an audience approaching that
size. (Pandora founder Tim Westergren claims that Pandora now accounts for
1.5% of all Internet traffic.) Such a royalty obligation might exceed the
total proceeds of all their recent rounds of venture capital plus all their
sales revenues to date.

[Wall Street Journal article][4]...the subtitle says it all: "Are Labels
Undermining Themselves?"

> (Pandora, a combination streaming-audio service and recommendation engine,
could be particularly hard hit by the new rules: As a multichannel operator,
the service would have to pay $500 per channel that has a certain number of
listener hours. Pandora has 6 million users, each of whom can have up to 100
channels. You can see why the company is worried.)

I quote that particular part because it highlights just how clueless both the
recording industry and politicians are about how "new" technologies work.

This stuff drives me CRAZY. And if Integration Research was still around and
viable, it would be scrambling to get some grassroots action going on this
issue. As it is, there's just little ol' me sitting here getting all pissed
off.

The frustrating part is not that an established, bloated industry is scared of
new technology. That is understandable. It's that they do the dumbest thing
possible in response to that OVER and OVER. This is the second time this issue
has come up in the last decade. It is like they know what they should do but
feel like they can't change their mind now that they've argued for so long!
