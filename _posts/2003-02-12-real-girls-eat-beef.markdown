"Funded by America's Beef Producers (sm) (c)2003 Cattlemen's Beef Board, National Cattlemen's Beef Association and Circle 1 Network"

It has health and fitness tips, tips on feeling good about yourself, a poll ("What type of beef do you most like to eat with your friends?"), and a set of Smart Snackin' recipes such as Nacho Beef Dip, Beef on Bamboo, Easy Beef Chili and Roast Beef and Veggie Wrap. And beef games too.
