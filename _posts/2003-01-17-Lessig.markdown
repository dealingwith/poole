Ever notice that <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/contact/pictures/">the pictures</a> of Lessig on his site suggest three things:



1. he's constantly reading (supreme court decisions?) from his computer screen.



2. yeah, must be supreme court decisions, because he's always frowning.



3. <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/contact/pictures/lessig_thinking_thumb.jpg">the</a> <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/contact/pictures/lessig_forehead_thumb.jpg">pictures</a> with his hand somewhere on his face are used most frequenty on his site since they distract from the fact that his face is exceptionally small in relation to his head.
