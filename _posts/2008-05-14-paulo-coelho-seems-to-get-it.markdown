[Best-Selling Author Turns Piracy into Profit][1]

> Paulo Coelho, author of books such as "The Alchemist" and "The Witch of
Portobello", sold over 100 million books last year. In part, he puts this
success down to BitTorrent, as he saw a huge increase in sales when his books
appeared on sites such as The Pirate Bay. We talked to Coelho to find out more
about this remarkable story.

"Since the dawn of time, human beings have felt the need to share - from food
to art. Sharing is part of the human condition. A person who does not share is
not only selfish, but bitter and alone," Coelho told TorrentFreak, explaining
why he decided to share his books for free.
