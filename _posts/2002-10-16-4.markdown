<i>Tech.Comment:</i> <b>Blogging for Dollars</b>

This topic has once again come up. I first read <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/08/12/megnut.html">some article</a> (don't know if that was the one) on it thanks to Cooper. Thought it was sadly funny. Then I was at Greenbelt and this guy actually <b>asks me</b>, "So do you make your living [by blogging]?" I was like, <b>sheyeah!</b> And he was like, "Oh I read that there are people doing that now." And I went, <b>yeah, like ONE</b>. (Miriam just goes, "Yeah, the <a href="http://www.thehomelessguy.blogspot.com/">the homeless guy</a>! And he doesn't have a bank account to receive the $$ with!")

Well now it's getting more complicated (re: <a href="http://www.ratcliffe.com/bizblog/2002/10/12.html#a33">Microsoft paying people to blog from their conferences</a>), but I like this summary from <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/16.html#blogging_for_pennies">dive into mark</a>:

<i>1. Wile away the best years of your life building a weblog and filling it with useful, interesting, relevant, topical, engaging content every day. 
2. ??? 
3. Profit! </i>
