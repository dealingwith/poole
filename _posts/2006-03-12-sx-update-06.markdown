The [Greenfield][1] Everyware talk was this: he's incredibly smart and well,
albeit soft, spoken. But it was packed so I was by the constantly opening and
closing door and it finally became too much and I bailed. My tolerance, while
still ok, is less than what it was. If I can't properly enjoy something then I
would rather move on. I was going to make a promise to myself to not feel
guilty about missing panels etc, but it's not even necessary. [Fray Cafe][2]
is tonight, for which I am tre excited.

had more to say but brain is shutting down early par usual. not getting the
volume of work done i wanted to, at all.
