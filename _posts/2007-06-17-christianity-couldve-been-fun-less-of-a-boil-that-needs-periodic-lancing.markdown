> "I think I prefer the pseudo-ideas and images people try to glean from
ancient religions and philosophies then the actual teachings. Especially made-
in-America popularizations of Asian scriptures. ..There's more space created
by words when history and context are mostly absent. It's cosmic."

"I thought it was lazy minds scanning excerpts of bad translations."

"Too bad I was taught to be a Christian and didn't happen upon it out of
curiosity like I did Voodoo and Buddhism. Christianity could've been fun--less
of a boil that needs periodic lancing."
