[A Brief Message: No Resistance Is Futile][1]:

> Now when I face a new writing project, I open a spreadsheet. I want a grid
to keep track of sources and dates, or to make certain that the timeline of a
story makes sense. The grid imposes brevity. Relationships between sentences
are exposed. Editing becomes a more explicit act of sorting, shuffling,
balancing paragraphs. In this spirit, I'm rewriting some blog software to read
directly from Excel. We'll see how that goes.
