Ftrain: [Real Empires Ship][1].

> This is all part of the digital lifestyle, coming at the middle class like a division of Panzer tanks. First they came for the vinyl, and I said nothing. Then for the cassettes, and the CDs, and the VHS tapes. Still I was silent. And now they will come for my books, sad little volumes trembling on their shelves. I look at my friends the books and I think, _sorry, fuckers_, for the iBrary is only a few dozen failed product launches away. Eventually (_waves hands_) this will all be stripes on disk.
