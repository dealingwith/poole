I didn't need my soul anyway. It was in the way. It was a burden. I have this important job now, and all these important people to see. Too much soul in the mix would hamper my quality time with all the movers and shakers.



I don't need to feel alive. Feeling alive makes you cry and this world was not made for crybabies.</blockquote>
