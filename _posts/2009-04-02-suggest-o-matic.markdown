I'm typing this in [Suggest-o-matic][1] (SOM), the very simplified culmination
of many years of thinking about content management, or what I refer to as
"creative management", that is, how we store and reference all the content we
create over the course of a life.

![][2]Right now, SOM is mostly like an automated reference librarian, who
[looks over your shoulder][3] as you're writing your paper and suggests things
out on the interwebs that might have to do with what you're writing about.

[This][1] is its very first iteration, what I am calling a [0.1 protoype][1]
...my intentions for the future are:

  * create multiple links for any given query (right now it can only
automatically create one link based on what you've clipped from your query

  * improving on the UI

  * ability to favor any number of site searches (I'm most interested in
searching _my_ old content for articles, images, etc. that I might have
already created on the subjects)

  * an automatic post-to-my-blog-or-whatever dealio

  * a run-on-any-page, white box + selected text Suggest-o-matic

  * serious natural language chops, so that special syntax is no longer needed
to fire off a suggestion

  * serious AI on results, so that SOM can sort and manage the relative links
automatically for you
