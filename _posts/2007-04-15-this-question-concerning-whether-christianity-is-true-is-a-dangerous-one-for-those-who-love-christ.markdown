[Overthe Rhine - Failed Christian][3]

Lately the only religious thoughts I've had are those while walking to the dog
park. There is a full gospel church at the end of my street, and on the way to
the dog park I walk by it. There are almost always people coming and going,
and the women all wear head coverings.

I had the thought today: Those who might accuse us of selectively choosing
from the Bible what is true are simply practicing a _selective
[hermaneutic][4]_.

A fairly obvious observation, but putting it so simply helped connect some
dots in my head. I meant to jot it down in this here journal but forgot, until
I came across this in my RSS reader:

[Christianity and truth][5]:

> ...However this question concerning whether Christianity is true is a
dangerous one for those who love Christ because its seeming innocence almost
always belies a deep assumption that ought to be interrogated. In the
popularised battle playing out today in the West between those who claim that
Christianity is true and those who claim that it is not the latter are winning
hands down...

...there is a much more basic question that one must ask before this question
can be understood properly. The question that one must ask is..."what is it
that Christianity claims when it claims to be true." ...the issue is...to work
out what...Christ meant when he claimed to be the truth. Without asking this
we end up simply embracing the commonly accepted definition of truth, we
accept the rules of the game that is being played and then wonder why we are
losing.

In short, let us first understand what Christ means by the word truth (which
is no easy task) and then meditate upon the truth, or otherwise, of
Christianity. So what is the truth of Christianity? ...The truth of
Christianity is life. The implications of this are vast...
