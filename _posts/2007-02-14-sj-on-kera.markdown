[Think on KERA 90.1 and KERA 13][1]

Sarah Jane will be on TV Friday talking about her latest project.

I can't remember the last time a friend of mine was on TV. Last time I was on
TV was when I was 15. I wonder if there is a VHS tape floating around of that;
I don't think so...would know.

Anyway, pretty cool. Who's going to let me come over to watch?
