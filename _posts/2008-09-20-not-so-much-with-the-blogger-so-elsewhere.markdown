Blogger hasn't let me log in for weeks. There is a work-around I found in the
support forums. Obviously. I'm posting here. But between the clunky interface
(apologies to Adaptive Path) and the seeming disregard Google has for the
product, it is finally time I think more seriously about moving this blog to a
new location. It is the only Blogger blog I _have never_ moved off the
platform, and with no denial of the irony, is the only one that has therefore
stayed stable and archive-ready for these 7 years.


Still, the trick to distributed content storage is being able to see the end
of the tracks and getting off the train before they pack up the servers and
turn the power off at the data center (not that that is going to happen
here...it's just a metaphor). LiveJournal is now a Russian company. I can't
log in to Blogger. It would seem that, yes, ["the blog" is dead][1].


Speaking of, I keep meaning to work on SWIM so that the version available for
download isn't a steaming pile of security-less bug-infested referential-
integrity-less shit (_overstating the problems_), but I actually have more
interesting content-tools-related plans involving the above-linked product
and/or other content tools and a clever algorithm. If I can just get any time
to work on it. I'm a bit busy with the day job at the moment.


All that to say, I will forward all feeds, have some very cool ways to slice
the content, and expect all this by the end of 2009. :)


Elsewhere in [my newly coined nonlinear category][2] on [my Живой Журнал][3]:

> ...Most products are made the wrong way. The industrial design is done
before the interaction designer and visual designers ever see the device, so
the device feels slapped together; what’s on the screen has nothing to do with
its form. Or maybe the product strategy causes the device to have too many
features until it is overburdened with unnecessary functionality and controls.
Or maybe the product is lifeless and has little personality aside from a list
of options.

...from [a post about Kicker][4]. And

> "I want to reform technology. All the tools are the same; people make the
same things with them. Everyone asks me, 'Are you bringing technology to
RISD?' I tell them, no, I'm bringing RISD to technology."

...from [a post about "John Maeda taking over the presidency of RISD, 'ambient
awareness' being talked about in the NYT, and all the noise about
chrome"][5]...all of which I have a lot more to say about, but need a bit more
time to put it all together.


[The "IR" tag might also be of interest to nonlinear types][6], which is
another "temporary" category for all the stuff I would have blogged at the
long-dormant [Integration Research][7]. Yeah, I still have plans for that
site, too...


[The "UX" tag is also stuff that should probably be over here][8]...
