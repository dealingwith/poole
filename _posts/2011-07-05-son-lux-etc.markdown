Sun Lux's new record _We Are Rising_ is a must have. It's blowing my mind more with every listen. There are a few songs that cut a little too close to the bone, and those I must skip. But overall it is a record well described by the title.

<p class="postscript">Ryan Lott himself replied to me on Twitter the other day. I must confess I was chuffed. He was even replying to a tweet I sent in reply to a separate conversation. I don't have the heart to tell him I can't listen to <em>Flowers</em> anymore, either.</p>
