50/100


You are a SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you a **Evil
Genius**.

You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With
luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect,
rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.

Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers
know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have
expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe,
calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and **your desire to
be right is impenetrable.

You are not to be messed with. You may explode**.

Of the 86656 people who have taken this quiz since tracking began (8/17/2004),
