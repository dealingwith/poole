> so today in the car, she was devising an experiment to create a vacuum and
see what would happen to oxygenated and un-oxygenated blood. like, you know,
would the oxygen leave the blood to form a gas? i told her to try it. and she
told me she was just seven and clearly could not but that she would do it when
she gets older. or tell her scientist friends to do it in case she became an
artist.

awesome.
