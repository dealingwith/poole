[Weekly Review (Harper's Magazine)][1]:

> It was discovered that a woman who paid a South Korean company to create
five clones of her pitbull Booger was Joyce McKinney, a former Miss Wyoming
who escaped British authorities in 1977 after abducting a Mormon missionary,
securing him to a bed with mink-lined handcuffs, and raping him three times.
