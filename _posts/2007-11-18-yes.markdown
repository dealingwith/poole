> There are thousands of reasons why people write blogs. But it seems to me
the biggest reason that drives the bloggers I read the most is, we're all
looking for our own personal global microbrand. That is the prize. That is the
ticket off the treadmill. And I don't think it's a bad one to aim for.

[I've started reading gapingvoid again recently][2] after taking some time off
(approx 9 months), and have been enjoying it immensely. We're thinking about
the same kind of things he just puts them into words and cartoons much better.

Have had a very nice balance of online and IRL interactions this week,
(meaning more IRL than usual).

Things are much different for me these days, and yet some things stay the
same.

I have to go shower etc because I'm about to go have more IRL with smart
beautiful inside/out kind of people.

I get a new bicycle tomorrow.

Yesterday I accidentally clicked "Mark all as read" instead of "Refresh" and
instantly went from 1000+ unread items in [Reader][4] to like 24 or whatever.
A user interface bug that might actually be a good thing.

Dan Wilson: "[Come Home Angel][5]" straight into "[Cry][6]" straight into
"Golden Girl" is a little heartbreaking, but beautiful!
