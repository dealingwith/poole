> I lit a candle at St. Barnabas with my Masonic Zippo, clacked it shut, a
deathless echo, retreated to the pew that had been in my family for four
generations. Actually two, three, something like that but I always follow my
mother's plus-one rule. Spring sat down next to me, smelling of freshly tilled
earth and phloem. She asked who my prayer was for, as if it'd duh obviously
been about her but let's be coy for a couple of minutes so she can pretend to
be in a romantic comedy scripted by committee. I said, "Pretty much none of
your particular beezwax." And she pressed me, still playing, linking her arm
through mine, freckled, a stream of earthworms and centipedes and pollen and
thorns, and I said, "Winter, OK? You happy now? And now it's going to be
rejected since I told you so it doesn't matter anymore anyway so way to go,
thanks." And she drew back, glared, gathered up her dress and paraded past the
stained glass windows. I unknotted my tie, undid the top button, but it was
too late, the heat was already unbearable. "Two bits for a swig a that,
padre," I said to the guy manning the holy water and he pretended to laugh.
