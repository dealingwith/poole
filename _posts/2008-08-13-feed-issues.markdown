Um, sorry RSS readers...you just got the last 15 posts having not received any
from me in some time, no? I've changed the main feed to just include the
Livejournal. If you wantthe links you'll have to subscribe to them separate.
I'll fix the feed links on the main site soon.

This is what I get for not subscribing to my own feed. We'll get this all
sorted out a lot better soon.
