[Seeing Green][3]

Originally uploaded by [Fixed Image][4]

Yesterday afternoon I went in to [the office][5], ostensively to _do_ some
work after an admittedly less-than-productive (in terms of deliverables) week.


I was able to do some organizing but [that was about it][6]. [Carissa][7] and
I still having [free babysitting][8], we decided to meet downtown to continue
our [super fun co-writing experiment][9]. On her way, Carissa ran into
[@geoffroper][10] riding his fixie around downtown, and so we enjoyed his
company at the bar for about an hour before he had to head home. After some
progress on our stories, we [considered going to the Happy Bullets show][11],
but decided to start heading home instead.


The Akard station was closed so we ended up walking by the new Opening Bell
coffee in downtown, which was _packed_. I was curious about the performance
space there, which is _very_ nicely done. We got to chatting with another
musician outside and found out it was [Dylan][12]'s [Texodus][13] show.


Well, it was an amazing show. [1][14] [2][15]


It was one of the best shows I've ever seen. I'm realizing that I won't be
able to do it justice with a blog post. And it was made all the more amazing
by all the coincidences that led us there, down to the two open seats right in
front, in an otherwise SRO room. Dylan's off to South Carolina, and will be
touring extensively. [If he comes through your town][16], do not miss your
chance to see this humble and inspiring performer.

[What I Thought][18]


Oh, [and go buy his record, too][19]...
