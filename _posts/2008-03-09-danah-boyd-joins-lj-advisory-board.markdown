[LiveJournal Advisory Board][1]

> As the advisory board started coming together, I got even more excited. Brad
Fitzpatrick, Esther Dyson, Lawrence Lessig... These are all people that I love
and trust, that I feel confident will work to protect community interests. SUP
has also decided that LiveJournal shall have two positions on the advisory
board set aside for user representatives that will be elected by the community
(more info on that coming later). To top things off, Jason Shellen will be
leading the U.S. LJ product team. (Jason and I worked very closely together at
Blogger/Google and I know that I can trust him to be community-minded.) In
other words, lots of folks I respect and lots of opportunity for meaningful
connections between users and the company.
