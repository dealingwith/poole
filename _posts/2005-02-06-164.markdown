The dog is very chilled out today. Not sure to what I owe this break from his
usual puppiness, but it's welcome. He is still very much afraid of the guitar.
Last (the first) time I tried to play guitar with him around, he freaked out
and I found it very funny and tormented him with a rousing G-C chord
progression until he pissed himself (my punishment for tormenting the dog).
Today I tried to very slowly introduce him to the guitar and plucked softly on
a couple strings. But he would have none of it. I'm not sure why he has this
severe adversion to guitars, but it must be remedied. Did his last owner beat
him senseless with one? He doesn't mind the stereo or any other loud noises,
just the guitar, even played softly.

He's also taken to his kennel quite easily. Not sure how that is. Life is much
easier since he started snoozing in there (pretty much right after we set it
up, and I can leave him in there when I go somewhere. Probly lived in one with
his previous owners.

When he wasn't getting a guitar broken over his back, that is.
