Washed Out, aka Ernest Greene, see, he [has his own blog][3] and YouTube
channel and as far as I can tell he's just a 26ish-year-old guy living in
rural Georgia who just got married and is making this incredible music in his
bedroom late at night.

[I put art on the Fail list][4] but really I've never had such a sense that
we've just entered an amazing time for art, particularly this [immediatist][5
]-yet-somehow-on-the-net thing that seems to be best and most perpetuated by
print designers and those well under 30. I'm really excited about it and have
this folder in my Google Reader that just blows my mind every time I look at
it which these days isn't very often, but...the funny part is that I have to
resist my old-man desires to try and jump on the aesthetic train and figure
out the best ways to publish all this shit to get eyeballs and [blah blah
blah][6]...although I do want to put out an electronic record of some sort
this year, and I'll for sure be listening to a lot of Glo-fi at the time...in
the meantime I have a gig in a week and a half and I have no idea what I'm
going to do for it. You know, I don't even have guitar calluses on my
fingertips anymore. It's shameful.

Anyhoo, besides those blogs Vimeo is also usually a ridiculous place to go
find [art that will blow your mind][7] (if you have enough bandwidth...with
our account it is usually a waiting game). On Vimeo I found what is possibly
the quintessential of said art, and they just happen to be videos set to
Washed Out and Dallas' own (getting rather big) Neon Indian. I can't embed the
Vimeo vids in LJ (another reason I'm hoping to transition blogging platforms
soon), but it's just one kid's (I use that pronoun to emphasize my oldness)
account, [here][8].

(When I was 26 I was about to move to DC. Soon I'd be divorced. 26 feels like
three lifetimes ago. The 00's was a hell of a decade for me. I predict this
next decade goes twice as fast and is half as exciting, but in a good way.)
