Why is this place always unique? It is never anything specific to the place {maybe the tube, or the sky, or the night}. It is the experiences. This place continues to exist as some alternative universe where the rest of my chaos swirls around in an opposite direction. This is the freewheel. The engine is about to tourqe clockwise, and then I realize I'm standing in the middle and everything is spinning the other way.



Snapshots are exactly that and only that. Fade to black and white now. Roll the movie of my life inside my head. Try to second guess what God's thinking. 'Cause He is a Joker, that One.
