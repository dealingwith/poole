She's totally getting it, by the way. She only plays creative mode for now, but she's a really quick study. She's learned all the key and mouse button functions. She watches me play and then just goes and figures out how to do the things she saw me do--from cattle ranching to bridge building. She learns the names of the blocks the first time. (Well, "acacia wood" took two times.) She's not quite 5 years old.
