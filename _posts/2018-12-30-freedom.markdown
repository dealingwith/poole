I don't normally kick off a year with much fanfare or resultion(s) but I am inspired at the moment to have a theme going into the new year. That theme is freedom.

So often we resolve to give things up or do extra things. I'm unhappy with my growing girth, so I should give up sugar, or at least the volume at which I consume it. I'm unhappy with my unhappiness, so I have to make time to work out and meditate. I'm unhappy with the quantity of my creative output, so I need to trade some free time to practice my art.

But this morning I had a sudden reframing: instead of giving things up, I could simply become more free of other things.

Freedom from resentment.
Freedom from despair.
Freedom from poor self-image.
Freedom from frustration.
Freedom from meaninglessness.
Freedom from regret.

Acquiring that freedom requires many things, but if I see those things as contributing to, not detracting from, my freedom, my feelings towards them changes considerably.

And at the center of many of it is the freedom from self. Or as twelve step programs ask, "Were we thinking of what we could do for others, of what we could pack into the stream of life?"
