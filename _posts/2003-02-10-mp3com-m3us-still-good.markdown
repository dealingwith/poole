Hey I was just checking my mp3.com m3u's and they still work. I uploaded them for your enjoyment, should you have not gotten over there and grabbed the good stuff before <a href="?archive=blog_2003_01_17.xml&id_pass=203">it went bye-bye</a>. There are all the hi-bandwidth stream versions. Also you can probably download the actual files from the information in those m3u's.



Also I noticed someone found my ChooseLife mp3 and posted it to a message board or something, my logs have a lot of downloads of that one. I had forgotten about it, so I'm going to take it down tomorrow sometime, so if you want it or the Walmart mp3, grab them from there a while too.
