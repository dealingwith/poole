...I experienced the highlight of my music performing career, at an open mic in front of 100 people (including the pool and darts players). {A career, just for those that might not know, that has included performances in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Florida in front of audiences of 300, 600, and 450, respectively.} 



This happened at an open mic, and by the fourth song (of an etiquette-smashing 7 song set), it had made its way to the top seat in this personal music hall-o'-fame. 



This happened because of community. This happened because handfuls of people I did not know last June allowed me to be a part of their lives and vice versa. This happened because through artistry--not music, genre, class, or success (however that is measured), but through <em>artistry</em>--a group of people can have a connection that transcends our mere existences in this consuming, brainwashed world.



Enough of that. Here are some highlights and pics:



== 1st ever standing-O/encore at the open mic

== goodbye cake (thanks Court)

== spontaneous jam session &amp; sing along

== all my peps in one room<blockquote>This is it people! Fame and better food will <em>not</em> satisfy!</blockquote>All pics by Miriam Miller:

The crowd. I love how this shot came out.

One of 2 percussionists to spontaneously drop into the groove and help me out. I also had the help of John on the lead electric guitar. In the background: darts players.
