Got back in touch with Steve Collins recently. 

He came to [Dallas](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smallritual/albums/72157642296938414) a few years ago now. It's always interesting to see what a foreign architect-photographer takes notice of in the town you live in.

I especially like his [signs](https://www.flickr.com/photos/smallritual/albums/72157691797873335) collection.
