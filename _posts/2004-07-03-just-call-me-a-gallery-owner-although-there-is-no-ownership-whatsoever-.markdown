This is going to be the craziest month evAr.





So Thursday I was walking to <a href="http://thegibsonco.com/">the gibson co</a> office to drop my rent check, and I noticed a storefront/residential space available on <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?location=l2Wd8efay%2fuL1f6HEbX0AWOQh366wfVZFE%2fIb%2fjt5rh%2fo6Kle0ih7C6DP8oPpxi17Ag%2bcVrIrfDdOTR6vxsxlvVls6eBMKfaty0D8cSuQbdH8pXsQaxUtr%2bO%2b2jgCsuawuVizdWLZSU%3d&address=Exposition%20Street%20&city=Dallas&state=TX&country=US">exposition</a>. Flashback w/in a flashback: last Friday <a href="http://soft_anonymous.blogspot.com/">KM</a> and I made a quick walk over to a gallery show in <a href="http://galleryeklektikos.com/">the space</a> next-door to the space in question, and in-between admiring the amazing art on display there I repeated, "This is exactly the kind of space I originally imagined for IR!" I did not notice the empty space next-door last Friday, but immediately put it together Thursday--it was almost identical. So while dropping the rent I made an inquiry--it is managed by the same company--and went to take a look.

...just in time for 600lbs of my crap from Bosnia to be delivered to the new place, leaving me with not-that-much stuff to move from my current location one street over. I'm planning on moving over the course of the next week.




...so here I am, stretched to the core in every way already, and entering into another high-risk venture...and I couldn't be more excited and positive...(and the <a href="http://www.tdfblog.com/">Tour de France</a> started today!)




It's going to be an interesting few months here.
