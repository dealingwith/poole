This one is already all over blogdom even this early in the morning, but <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/3476">here it is</a> (here's a link straight to the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/">licenses</a>). <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave</a> is even burning the 5.30am oil because of it. I've had <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> in my favorites for a very long time, this seems to be their big thing, purpose for being, you know, and all that.
