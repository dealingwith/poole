I refreshed [my site][1] yesterday, for winter/the holidays. Still have
content issues. Slowly working on that bit.

**Update**: Just added another little touch. You can't see it when you just
visit the site; you must do something. Let's just say there's someone with a
special message just for you.

I've been uploading mp3s but not posting, so here goes:

[Cake - Wheels][2]. I found this one yesterday on my hard drive. I think it
had been there for a while. I'm a big Cake fan. I had never heard this song
before. It's...apt.

[Johnny Cash - The Man Who Couldn't Cry][3]. I just like this song.

[Perla Batalla & Julie Christensen - Anthem][4]. More Cohen. _There is a crack
in everything / That's how the light gets in_

[Denison Witmer - These Days][5]. [St. Vincent - These Days][6]. Not a big
Jackson Browne guy myself, but both of these covers of this beautiful song
entered my life recently.

and finally...

I've uploaded these for certain people to hear, and might as well share. These
are the last two songs we did at Pleasantry Lane:

[Daniel Miller - Our World][7]

[Daniel Miller - American Dream Town (2006)][8]

...and your QotD:

> the one thing i don't understand about technology is it's ability to change
w/o request. i don't understand how, for a non-tech example, i can put a brick
on a table in a controlled environment, lock the door and of course the brick
just sits there. then one undefined amount of time later i come back and the
brick has decided to be a cupcake and chill in the corner.

design
