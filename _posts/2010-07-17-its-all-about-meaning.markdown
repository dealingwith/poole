All those other things—authority/fame/money/metanarrative—just validate the
meaning (or create meaning where there was none). When someone says something
is important, what they really mean is that it has meaning. When people do
things that we consider absurd or stupid, those things are creating/validating
meaning for those people.


This is a similar structure to Lacan's _objet petit a_*, but in place of our
ideal self is the meaning, and in place of the other is the Meaning Validation
Device™.


This is important to remember when thinking about motivation—we are ultimately
motivated by the meaning.


This is why stories and empathy are so important.

* There are a lot of definitions of what the _objet petit a_ is, the above is
my most simple explanation of the definition that best suites my purposes—we
seek out an other who reflects back on us our ideal self.
