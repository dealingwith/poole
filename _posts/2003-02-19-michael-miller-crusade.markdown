<a href="http://www.michaelmillercrusade.com/">michael miller</a>



two major recommendations in a row! i first found michael miller through <a href="http://jeansandatshirt.com/index.html">jeans and a tshirt</a>, their <a href="http://jeansandatshirt.com/monthlymix.html">monthly mix</a> to be precise, not this month's but last month's, but this month's has <a href="http://jeansandatshirt.com/music/track13.mp3">one of his songs too</a>, grace town (nice title, eh?). this month they also have an <a href="http://jeansandatshirt.com/archives/000169.html#000169">interview with him</a>. 



if you check out nothing else on his site, check his travel photos. he has a great eye. but he also does illustrations, <a href="http://www.heymikeyboy.com/">funny ass christmas cards</a>, and for a little added weirdness he used to work with <a href="http://www.charliepeacock.com/html">charlie peacock</a> of all people and recorded his first (of 2) CD's with Mike Roe and Bruce Spencer (from the 77's). the scariest thing of all? he sounds and looks <em>a lot</em> like <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/412/andy_zipf.html">andy zipf</a>.
