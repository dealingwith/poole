And oh yeah, I'm showing my photography at Common Grounds coffee shop in September. More details later but suffice it to say this is a tre cool shop and it is going to be equally cool to show there. I have the side room for the month. I will figure out how to do an opening and all that soon...stay tuned...<a href="http://eg.washingtonpost.com/profile/1028182/?&flavor_id=2&context=restaurants">only decent link for common grounds i've found so far</a>...
