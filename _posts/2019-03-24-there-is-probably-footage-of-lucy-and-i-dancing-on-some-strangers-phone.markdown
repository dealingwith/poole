...and that's ok because we were **killing** it on the dancefloor last night at our first daddy-daughter dance!

This girl is **fierce**.

I will admit. I was anxious. I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know what I was going to wear. But we figured something out that matched Lucy's new dress. We took photos with the big camera outside. Then Lucy and I went to Sa Sa Sushi. We both had Japanese soda. She had a rainbow roll. We ran into a good friend of mine who without any coordination had the same plan as me. 

Then we went to the venue. We were a little bit early so we took a walk around the park surrounding the recreation center.

Inside, we confirmed our registration, grabbed a small bag of Cool Ranch Doritos, and made our way to the photo booth. After we got our few snaps in, Lucy informed the photographer there, in a sweet way, that her mother is a photographer. She's already better in social situations than I am.

Then the scary part...the gymnasium. It was already set up as a giant dance floor, with decorations, a DJ you couldn't understand and disco lights. Lucy wasted no time.

Lucy can **dance**, ya'll. I take some time to warm up and moved subtly, covering the huge smile on my face at seeing Lucy just bust a move. There was a lot of swinging her around in a circle. The dance floor filled up. I started to find my dancing legs.

**All** the great pop dance hits. Before long I was drenched in sweat. I sweat through to my jacket. It was so much fun.
