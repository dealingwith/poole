[The Archive][1] from [Sean Dunne][2] on [Vimeo][3].

> Paul Mawhinney was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA. Over the years he has
amassed what has become the world's largest record collection. Due to health
issues and a struggling record industry Paul is being forced to sell his
collection.

This is the story of a man and his records. I hope you enjoy it.
