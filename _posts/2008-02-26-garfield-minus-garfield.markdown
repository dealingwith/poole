garfield minus garfield][2]

> Who would have guessed that when you remove Garfield from the Garfield comic
strips, the result is an even better comic about schizophrenia, bipolor
disorder, and the empty desperation of modern life? Friends, meet Jon
Arbuckle. Letâ€™s laugh and learn with him on a journey deep into the tortured
mind of an isolated young everyman as he fights a losing battle against
lonliness and methamphetamine addiction in a quiet American suburb.
