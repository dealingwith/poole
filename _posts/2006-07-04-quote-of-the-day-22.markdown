> Every time I meet a decent woman she's somebody's boyfriend, or a friend's
recent ex or sister or hot mom, or she's way into Star Trek, or she likes to
go bowling. Or she's a lesbian and doesn't know it, or she's a vegan, she
doesn't drink, she's not old enough to buy cigarettes, she used to be a man,
or she only dates musicians, she drives an eighteen wheeler, she drinks her
own urine as some sort of spiritual ritual, she goes sky-diving naked, or she
doesn't have freckles, or she's a cyclops, or she's a ghost. Maybe she's into
pyronecrobestiality, or she eats peanut butter right from the jar, or she's a
republican, or she's one of Captain Planet's Planeteers, or she's afraid of
sex, or she wishes I were dead, or she smokes opium every day, or she hates
cartoons, or she's into sports or worst yet. She's religious.
