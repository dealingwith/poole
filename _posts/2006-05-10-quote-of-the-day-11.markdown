from a conversation last night (not exact quote): _There's, "[This bad thing,
this bad thing, this bad thing] happened to me, so what choice to I have other
than get my shit totally together?" and then there's, "[This bad thing, this
bad thing, this bad thing] happened to me, so how could I not be f*cked up?"_
