<a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/6/1/124527/7208">kuro5hin: The hidden facts of our cabal</a><blockquote>The neo-conservative team that rules our planet is shrouded in secrecy. Where did they come from? What are their real names? How many of them are wearing wigs? 



I don't know the answers to any of these questions, but there is one thing that we do know about these people: They all have children... And behind each child lies an act so deplorable, so ridiculous and vile, that I have trouble naming it. This little-known phenomneon, that our leaders are engaged in and obsessed with, is known on the street as 'sex'.



My research began a few months ago when I couldn't help but notice how often the various leaders of our country are seen alongisde their children. 



This got me thinking. Where do children come from? After extensive research I found Dr. Mark Hopkins, of Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. 



Dr Hopkins told me that children, in fact, come from a disgusting and fluid-laden act called 'Sexual Intercourse'...



Thats right...Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell, Franks, all of these people, bottom bouncing ejaculate spraying lip locking sexual freak addicts. Perverts. Their wives eager participants in this danse macabre, the satanic hedonism of the dark hours supressed for so long at last overwhelming these sick, twisted, and tormented souls...



I would humbly ask that everyone within the sound of my voice or the reach of my type, to please call , fax, or phone your congressional representatives, your church or mosque officials, your religious and community leaders, your local feminist organization, the ACLU, and your local chapter of the knights of columbus, the rotary club, and the jaycees, and alert them all to what exactly is going on in the mind of the president. Urge them to pass or support the passage of House Resolution 3117, which would imediately ban all acts of this lewd behavior amongst human beings, and which would restrict expression or flaunting or encouragement that these acts take place...</blockquote>
