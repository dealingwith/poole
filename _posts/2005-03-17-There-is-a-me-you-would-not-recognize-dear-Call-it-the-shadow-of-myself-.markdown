<blockquote>Breathe in good, breathe out bad,

Remind yourself of the things you have, it's easy.

Pull a smile onto your face,

Understand that making friends is easy.



So tell yourself it will be ok,

Remind yourself that you're not just in it for the money.

The end, the end, the end, the end,

My friend, where's the end?

You're up, you're down,

You're in the ground in the end, my friend,

Where's the end?



I've found myself, deep down in the dirt,

Got to get myself to my feet yeah.

I tell myself it will be ok,

Remind myself that I'm not just in it for the money.

The end, the end, the end, the end

My friend, where's the end?



You're up, you're down,

You're in the ground in the end, my friend,

Where's the end?</blockquote>

myself and most people around me are in various states of complete chaos. the only good thing is that when the hurricane is already upon you, you find those trees to grab hold of fast.
