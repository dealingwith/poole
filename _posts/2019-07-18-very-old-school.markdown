[Let’s Talk Like We Used To](https://www.raptitude.com/2019/07/lets-talk-like-we-used-to/#comments)

>...the internet itself has also changed. As one astute [tweet](https://twitter.com/badnetworker/status/1133363823728091136) put it, "1999: there are thousands of websites, all hyperlinked together. 2019: there are four websites, each filled with screenshots of the other three.""

>I got caught up in the unimaginative tenets of the Age of Content. It’s got to land. It’s got to pull in eyeballs. It’s got to be shareable. Nothing too long, nothing too short. Nothing avant-garde. Facebook’s share count will tell you how well you did.

>My process filled with doubt and overthinking, and that really suffocated any sense that I was free to share whatever moved me. Yet the site is still the same thing it ever was, mechanically at least. It’s still just a web log where I can broadcast my thoughts.

>I guess what I’m trying to say is that I love you, and I love how we used to just talk. I’m going to approach blogging in the free-form way I used to. That means I’m going to be saying things more often, with fewer words, and with much less hand-wringing over those words. 

I'm glad this blog never became a Thing. It's always just been my little homestead on the Internet. I write about technology, art, society, my life...it's honestly the worst strategy for _the Age of Content_. And I'm ok with that.
