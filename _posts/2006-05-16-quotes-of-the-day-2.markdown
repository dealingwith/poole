"We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing. Action
always generates inspiration. Inspiration seldom generates action." – Frank
Tibolt

"Far better it is to dare mighty things to win glorious triumphs, even though
checkered with failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither
enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that know
not victory or defeat." – Theodore Roosevelt
