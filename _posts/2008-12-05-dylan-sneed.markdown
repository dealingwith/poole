Great show last night.

In other news, I've been blocked* on Flickr by someone I don't even know IRL.
I normally wouldn't give a shit, god knows I have plenty of enemies, but WTF?!
It's made me paranoid.

* (I know because I was going to use his picture to illustrate this post. LJ
friends have probably seen the "photo unavailable" Flickr thing for a while.
Even more strangely, when I "Flickr mailed" him about the disappearance of the
photo he sent me a link to download the original, but I didn't want to
actually host someone else's photo anywhere, just for the purposes of this
post about the show.)
