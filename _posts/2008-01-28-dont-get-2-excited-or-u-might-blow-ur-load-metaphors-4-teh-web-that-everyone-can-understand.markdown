My comment on a blog posting [this article, "Searching for the truth
online"][1].

Well the article and its accompanying video are horrible and in that sense
proving their own point--i.e. they don't understand this particular
information/technology landscape either. The web has been overhyped and
overvalued since the beginning and "Web 2.0" is no exception. And in some
sense it is a self-feeding machine now, with so much of that hype originating
in the navel-gazing blindrooms of the nerdosphere.

I think the long-term winners are those that focus on tools that solve age-old
problems of information and communication, or introduce new constraints on the
collective load introduced by all these new technologies. Otherwise we're just
going to continue to have cycles of premature load-blowing over each new trend
and a collective retreat when we realize it's much better when we take our
time and enjoy the process and respect one another. And we'll have somewhat
sad press like that above each time we cycle through.
