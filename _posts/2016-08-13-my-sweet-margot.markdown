6 years ago today my first daughter was declared brain dead and taken off of life support. They gave us some time alone with her before those events, and through sobs I sang along to "I'll Fly Away" while kneeling beside her hospital bed. I can't remember the last moment I saw her really alive. It would have been when I was leaving for a business trip, so I assume I kissed her and told her I loved her and that I would see her soon.

Today Lucy said, "I wish I had a sister." I said, "Well, Lucy, someday we will tell you a story."
