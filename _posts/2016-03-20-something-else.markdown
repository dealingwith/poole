> They never tell you truth is subjective  
> They only tell you not to lie  
> They never tell you there's strength in vulnerability  
> They only tell you not to cry  

> But I've been living underground  
> Sleeping on the way  
> And finding something else to say  
> Is like walking on the freeway

> They never tell you you don't need to be ashamed  
> They only tell you to deny  
> So is it true that only good girls go to heaven?  
> They only sell you what you buy

> And I've been living underground  
> Sleeping on the way  
> And finding something else to say  
> Is like walking on the freeway

I thought for sure I had blogged about this song before. I know I used it in a ill-received sermon I gave once during my days of having opinions to share in such contexts. 

I would point out a lyric or two, but they're all just too good. One of my favorite songs of all time. I was happy to re-discover it tonight.
