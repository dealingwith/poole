[Non-linear: Ambient Technology][5]:

> This oft-neglected blog might appear to be solely about ARG marketing/gaming
and digital art, but this thing I've labeled as "nonlinear" since 2001 is
finding a new presence thanks to Twitter, Last.fm, etc. And this thing is
getting a new name; I've been calling it Ambient Technology...

I posted on my other blog today for the first time in a long time,
particularly if you count more than just links...lots more to say in this area
and I think that is the venue for it (as opposed to here). Two words of the
day (phatic and osmotic) and pretty much the concept of the day over there.
