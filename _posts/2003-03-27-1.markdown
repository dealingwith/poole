<a href="http://www.remhq.com/finalStraw/finalstraw.html">r.e.m.: final straw</a><blockquote>Now love cannot be called into question.

Forgiveness is the only hope I hold.

And love--love will be my strongest weapon.

I do believe that I am not alone.



For this fear will not destroy me.

And the tears that have been shed

It's knowing now where I am weakest

And the voice in my head. In my head.



Then I raise my voice up higher

And I look you in the eye

And I offer love with one condition.

With conviction, tell me why.

Tell me why.

Tell me why.

Look me in the eye.

Tell me why.</blockquote>The link goes to a page where you can choose between Windows Media or Quicktime. Via the newly redesigned <a href="http://jeansandatshirt.com/index.html">jeansandatshirt</a>.
