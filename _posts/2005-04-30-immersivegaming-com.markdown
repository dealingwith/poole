![][1][immersivegaming.com][2]: This Is Not A Game.


Pretty cheesy site promoting the book "[This Is Not A Game][3]."

> Imagine a world of mystery and excitement, adventure and fantasy, waiting
for you to explore. A world that reacts to your every move, with characters
and companies that talk to you, send you messages, and even give you items to
help you in your quest. A world so immersive that you can no longer tell where
the reality ends and the fiction begins. Welcome to the world of Alternate
Reality Gaming. This Is Not A Game: A Guide to Alternate Reality Gaming by
Dave Szulborski is the perfect introduction to the unique and exciting world
of Alternate Reality Games. Written by the creator of five successful and
critically acclaimed ARGs, This Is Not A Game features detailed sections on
the theory and history of Alternate Reality Gaming, as well as a “How To
Guide” for aspiring game creators. The book also includes Dave’s personal
reflections on creating some of the most popular ARGs ever developed, and
essays on gaming and cooperative writing by award winning authors Ben Mack and
Joseph Matheny.

I'll leave the rest of my negative comments to myself, but I'm still
considering laying out the 25 clams at lulu for the book.
