Chuck Palahniuk wrote Fight Club, Choke, Survivor, and Invisible Monster. I've seen Fight Club and read Choke. Invisible Monster is my next read and I'm told it is very non-linear. Just to say, again, that storytelling is moving in this direction. Check him out if you have not already. Amazing stuff.

:: Update: Read Invisible Monsters. Amazing read. Very nonlinear. Very cool. Read it if you dare.
