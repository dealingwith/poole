I wrote to a friend yesterday: "i'm sequestered/chained to the computer watching deadlines fly by me at light speed...." It seems that there is 25 hours worth of work to do a day. This is when I wish I had insomnia instead of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=define%3A+TMJ">TMJ</a>.





<a href="../art/writing">The book</a> has been pushed back to 2005. I worked on it from 4pm-7am Tuesday night and realized a few things: it wasn't going to get done, squeezed in between the other priority work; it was going to take a bit more effort than I first estimated (this can be said about all of my endeavors); it was an emotional strain that needed to be spread out...





You can get a sneek peek at comments in <a href="http://underde.com/swim">SWIM</a> over at <a href="http://halsamples.com/blog">halsamples.com</a>. SWIM's official release date continues to be pushed back, for many reasons, but will hopefully still be within 2004 here. Threaded comments were not part of the original spec, no. I had a very functional prototype working within a few hours over Thanksgiving. But in the name of SWIM's template system and the separation of data and design, I had to break it and put it back together again, which took two 14 hour days. I finally finished and installed it last night at 1:30 and ran across the street to celebrate before last call. Turns out the owner was bartending so last call wasn't such a hard-and-fast deadline after all. You know, the local business owners have to stick together. And/or drink together.





Say what you will about Hal, but his goal is to raise awareness concerning the homeless issue in Dallas, and he's succeeding at that. <a href="http://halsamples.com/blog/files/2004/12/Clip_1_FC1r2.mov">He was the subject of a Fox News piece about meth this week (8.6M .mov)</a>. <a href="http://halsamples.com/blog/files/2004/12/Clip_2_FC1.mov">Same night ABC ran a story on the sweep outside of the Day Resource Center (4.5M .mov)</a> etc. Let me paraphrase our dear mayor:<blockquote>If I hadn't warned you that I was going to shoot you in the face with this .45, I would say I was at fault; but I <em>told</em> you I was about to shoot you in the face with this .45 and you didn't move!</blockquote>Next morning Hal calls me at 10:20 to tell me he's going to be on the radio at 10:30. Now I don't have a TV or a functional radio, but turns out <a href="http://www.990mainstreet.com/">990mainstreet.com</a> has an excellent online audio feed, which was crystal clear for the entire hour and a half. I got the whole thing on wav, which I have edited down to three manageable mp3's: <a href="http://halsamples.com/blog/files/2004/12/hal%20samples%20on%20kevin%20mccarthy%20-%20segment%20with%20hal.mp3">Kevin McCarthy Show - Hal Samples - interview (6.4M mp3)</a>, <a href="http://halsamples.com/blog/files/2004/12/hal%20samples%20on%20kevin%20mccarthy%20-%20segment%202%20-%20callers.mp3">Kevin McCarthy Show - Hal Samples - callers 1 (9.1M mp3)</a>, <a href="http://halsamples.com/blog/files/2004/12/hal%20samples%20on%20kevin%20mccarthy%20-%20segment%203%20-%20callers.mp3">Kevin McCarthy Show - Hal Samples - callers 2 (10.4M mp3)</a>. Good stuff. The beginning (first 1:35) of that last one there is awesome.

Yesterday was a manic-depressed code day, one bug after another, the joy of fixing one and the bummer of the next one immediately popping up. During one of the more <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/caffeine/drinks/5b74/">Monster</a>-induced manic periods, I danced my happy ass right off to <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/media/The%20Waiting%20-%20I%20Want%20You%20Back.mp3">The Waiting - I Want You Back (3.4M mp3)</a> (a Jackson 5 cover, FYI, in case you're culturally challenged). That song makes me happy.



Said ass was later re-attached.
