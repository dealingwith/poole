Someone went to the Sigur Ros show last week. Someone squeezed their way up to the stage. Someone had their digital camera. Someone made a lot of other observations and was going to write them all down, but now is not the time. Like their music (1st record sung in Icelandic, second in their own made-up language), words cannot do the experience justice. All images beyond:

No flash on any of these pics. On that last one, I had already gone back to the bar to stand with <a href="http://boboroshi.com">John</a>...I had been stageside for at least half of the set, waiting for the singer to come back to this microphone...I gave up, but when I saw him finally go back to it during one song of the encore, I marched back up there, propped the camera on a speaker (above my head and at arms length, I could barely see the LCD), and shot the rest of my memory card. Lovely that they saw fit to use a lot of white lighting during that song as well...
