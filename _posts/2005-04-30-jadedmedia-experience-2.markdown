[jadedmedia experience 2][1]

> jadedmedia is an online project put together by a team of collaborators. the
intention is to keep you guessing by helping you see what you already know.
the project has been put together by friends, colleagues, and allies. it is an
alternative to what you would normally do in a place that is not even there.


jadedmedia started out as a lie. it evolved into a half-truth. in its present
form, it can hide the lies through half-truths, or it can expose the half-
truths through lies. it's all up to the eye of the beholder.


jadedmedia is a beautiful thing in the ugliest sense. it is the high, the low,
the far, the near, the up, the down. it is a veritable fountain of
information, but it's really not saying much of anything,


jadedmedia is what you make of it. you are the beholder. [#][2]
