At the risk of being campy myself and <a href="http://www.danielsjourney.com/miriam/2003_02_01_archives.html#88551277">linking to Miriam's site, I thought I'd post this</a> just in case for some unfathomable reason you hadn't already read it, or needed clarification of some sort.



The language ranking system in the Foreign Service is 1-5, 5 being the topmost, totally fluent native speaker. You get two scores, one for speaking and one for reading. In case you missed it <a href="http://www.danielsjourney.com/miriam/2002_07_01_archives.html#78914973">a while back she only got "4+/4+" in her native <i>freaking</i> language</a> (but she took it so well) just because she didn't go to University in Slovakia! Hello?! She spoke better Slovak than the people testing her!



Well anyway, she just had a progress test for Bosnian, which she has only had full time training in for a handful of weeks, and she already scored a 3/3. A-freaking-mazing. <s>Only trouble is, now they might send us even earlier, or worse, make her work at the main St. Dept!</s> (Update: Miriam worked her magic <i>again</i> so no chance of that!)



No one will be negotiating those contracts with the local Bosnians as well as Miriam, ever!



(P.S. If you had bad thoughts re: the title of this post hit yourself upside the head for me.)
