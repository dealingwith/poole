Don't leave, winter  
I still need your warm sweaters  
Your hot tea  
The way you set the sun  

Don't leave, winter  
Spring's rains are followed too fast by hot hot hot  
I'll long for your comfort and cold  
Your gentle sounds and days at home  

Don't leave, winter  
You leave time for reading  
Space for thinking  
Room for feelings  

Don't leave, winter  
It's been such a short time  
That you've blessed me with your presence  
Don't let your anxious cousin summer invade
