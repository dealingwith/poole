All you  
whose whole family  
gathers around the table  
give thanks  
  
All you  
who kiss your sons  
and daughters this day  
give thanks  
  
All you  
burdened only by things  
of this world, room and board  
give thanks  
  
All you  
sent to sea by things  
less than this, get over yourself  
give thanks  
  
All you  
for whom death is an idea  
who can argue for its machines' perpetuation  
give thanks  
  
All you  
who can eat  
or laugh  
or sleep  
or reason  
or type  
or speak  
or listen  
or breathe  
or work  
or think  
without pain  
give thanks
