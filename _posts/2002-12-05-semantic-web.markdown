title: 'semantic web'
---

I've mentioned the <a href="http://www.w3c.org/2001/sw/">semantic web</a> a
few times in the past. It is a subject I am both a student and evangelist
of. I would talk a lot more about it if I understood it enough to put it into
simple terms. But again, in an effort to use this space to sort
through some of my backlog of info, here we go. Scan the bold type for topics that
interest or intrigue you.

<b>XFML:</b> <a href ='http://xfml.org/'>XFML xml format for shared, faceted taxonomy of metadata</a>

<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/03.html#this_is_xfml">diveintomark: this is XFML</a>

<a href ='http://poorbuthappy.com/ease/000506.html'>Ease What does XFML look like</a>

<a href ='http://xfml.net/'>XFML Wiki</a> 

so what's a <b>wiki</b>? glad i asked...

<a href ='http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiGettingStartedFaq'>Wiki Getting Started Faq</a>

yeah, but what's <b>taxonomy</b>? glad i asked...

<a href ='http://www.lexonomy.com/publications/aTaxonomyPrimer.html'>Lexonomy  A Taxonomy Primer</a> from this consultant's site <a href ='http://www.lexonomy.com/'>Lexonomy</a>

so people, like, real <b>consultants</b> and stuff, are totally working with these
things? like, this isn't a fluke? could i do this? are there more? hmm...<a href ='http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000005.php'>Semantic Studios  Publications  Semantics  Innovation Architecture</a> from <a href ='http://semanticstudios.com/'>Semantic Studios</a> 

So you know this XML <b>RSS</b> stuff has to do with the semantic web too, and over
here at design.danielsjourney we are working hard at building SWiM
on a very extensible information architecture that will help us maintain a
semantic paradigm, not to mention add feature after feature with few
architectural changes (if any).

more RSS info: <a href ='http://www.syndic8.com/~wkearney/blogs/syndic8/'>Syndication News from Bill Kearney</a>

and <b>yet another XML format</b>! wow can we have one for each day of the year?
please? <a href ='http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/'>RDFWeb FOAF the 'friend of a friend' vocabulary</a>.

although i do like this tagline: <a href ='http://rdfweb.org/'>RDFWeb semantic web vapourware for the masses</a>

this of course all depends on <b>standards</b> for client tools. here's a
good site re that: <a href ='http://www.webstandards.org/'>The Web Standards Project</a>

not to mention good <b>information architecture</b> underneath our tools and
web services: <a href ='http://www.newarchitectmag.com/documents/s=2452/na1202b/index.html'>New Architect Bottoms Up</a>of course to create standards and architecture that actually work, we need to understand <b>user
interface</b>, how the brain works and how it works in relation to technology,
even more specifically, how it works in relation to <b>information and how we
can best represent that information through technology</b>. this is a subject <a href="http://nonlinear.blogspot.com/">i
have been very interested in</a> for a long time (the psych grad in me coming
out). anyway, there is a dept at UC Berkeley that is working on this stuff, and
it's tre cool:

<a href ='http://bailando.sims.berkeley.edu/index.html'>BAILANDO Project Homepage</a>

<a href ='http://bailando.sims.berkeley.edu/infovis.html'>BAILANDO Project Information Visualization</a>

and here's one more UI article, unrelated to the UCB projects: <a href ='http://www.infoworld.com/articles/op/xml/02/11/28/021128opwebserv.xml'>Multimodal user interfaces</a> 

this is related--deals with the actual <b>hardware piece of UI</b> more--and
also just <b>tre cool for the tweaker in all of us</b>: <a href ='http://riot.com.au/systems.php'>riot.com.au - systems</a> 

here are some good tech <b>blogs</b> as well:
<a href ='http://www.fettig.net/'>Abe Fettig</a>
<a href ='http://www.onfocus.com/'>Paul Bausch</a> (cofounder of blogger)
<a href ='http://www.hebditch.org/'>Stephen Hebditch</a>

<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6491&mode=thread&order=0">Doc
S ON blogs and how they fit into this</a> (sortof--never been a big Doc fan, but
I know alot of peps are)

and yet another <b>content/knowledge management</b> product:

<a href ='http://www.novissio.com/index.html'>Novissio - Bringing knowledge to life</a> 

another techy thing we really need in order to achieve <a href="http://integrationresearch.org">my dream of sustainability for all</a> is <b>micropayments</b>. Found another offering in this area yesterday:

<a href ='http://www.peppercoin.com/'>Micropayments and Electronic Payment Systems for Microtransactions PEPPERCOIN</a>

and speaking of sustainability, part of that is subverting existing
<b> marketing structures</b>, and in thinking of that, and surfing, I realized that this is true: <a href ='http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,56677,00.html'>Wired News Apple It's All About the Brand</a>.
