[more reason to like this guy. he puts Johnny Cash on in the team bus.][3]

this tour made me more excited about cycling (in general) than any race has
since [1989][4]'s [1990][5]'s Tours.

i also liked [this video][6] for representing much of what i like about
cycling's infrastructure -- intelligent europeans...kinda different from beer-
gut-face-painted-shirt-off-foam-hand-thing ppl typish of americanish sportler
