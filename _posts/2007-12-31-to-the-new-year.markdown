Just woke up from a weird dream that I'm unsure has any real meaning, but one
thing I do know; the transition from 2007 to 2008 has significantly more
significance than the transition from 2006 to 2007 did. In fact the change
that 2007 brought about halfway through, the very change it was supposed to
bring upon its arrival (see cartoon above), has had time to take effect,
making this somewhat arbitrary moment in personal history a nice marker.

Here's to 2008, and a year of 100% more happy, 100% more productive, 100% more
content, 100% less depressed, 100% less suicidal.

2007: [Tragic Mirror][2], [John, Let Me Go][3]

2008: [After All][4], [She's Fantastic][5]
