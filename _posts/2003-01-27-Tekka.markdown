Just found <a href="http://www.tekka.net/">Tekka.net</a> via <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000826">aaron swartz's blog</a> (he's going to write for it; btw, if you ever need a shot of humility just go to his site...he's a genius). Anyway, it's an <a href="http://www.eastgate.com">Eastgate</a> thing. Eastgate is very close in many areas to what I want to do/what I'm interested in. I've always struggled getting really into their stuff, though. For example I can't tell <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/Tekka.html">by the description of Tekka on the subscription page</a> whether it's worth the money. Sounds like maybe, and if it were 20-25 clams, I'd do it already. But for 50 I need more than a promise that it's {eddiemurphy}"what a bah-gin!"{/eddiemurphy}
