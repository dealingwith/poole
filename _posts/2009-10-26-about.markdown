When pressed for a new "about me" for my [Google Profile][1], which I was
setting up now just so I could test drive their new [social search][2]:

> Too much a designer for the developers and too much a developer for the
designers.

Too much a heathen for the Christians and too religious for the heathen.

Too much a lycra-wearer for the hipster fixie crowd and not hardcore enough
for the racing scene.

Too much a fan of pop music for the indie scene and not glamorous enough for
pop music.

Too opinionated about art for the local art scene but too into outsider art
for the art academy.

Too much a meritocrat for socialism but too humanist for capitalism.

I live on the edge, in the sense of the word that involves lots of paper cuts.
