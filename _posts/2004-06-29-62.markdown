The other day I went to get gas and there was a person smoking right next to
the pumps next to me. Then I saw that the guy actually pumping gas there was
smoking. I couldn't freaking believe it. I have never seen anyone smoking
while pumping gas before. I promptly fled the scene.

Last night there was a dog sleeping in the middle of the street at 2AM. He
didn't move for us. We moved for him. He just looked up for a second and then
went back to sleep. In the middle of the street.
