"You are an SRDL--Sober Rational Destructive Leader. This makes you a mob
boss. You are the ultimate alpha person and even your friends give you your
space. You can't stand whiners, weaklings, schlemiels or schlemozzles. You
don't make many jokes, but when you do, others laugh out loud. They must.

"People often turn to you for advice, and wisely. You are calm in a crisis,
cautious in a tempest, and attuned to even the finest details. Yours is the
profile of a smart head for business and a dangerous enemy.

"You have a natural knack for fashion and occupy a suit like a matinee idol.
Your charisma is striking and without artifice. You are generous, thoughtful,
and appreciate life's finer things.

"Please don't kick my ass."
