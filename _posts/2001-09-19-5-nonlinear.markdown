**The Original Business Proposition**


The following are from a slide presentation indended for those interested in
the possibility of an online gaming venture, with the future possiblity of
creating a piece of desktop software that would help build these non-linear
games, as well as influence many markets mentioned within this document. I am
not too forthcoming with the spec's on the software, however the spec does
continue to evolve and is closely linked to the higher level discussion here.


Bottom line for investors or other interested parties: very little upfront
investment, great time to market, and great revenue streams. This could never
be a multi-million dollar business, but it could be a very interesting buy for
a Microsoft, particularly if the software I have in mind were as extensive as
I imagine it.


Here are the presentation slides:
