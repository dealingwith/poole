_"What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of
its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention,
and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of
information sources that might consume it." (Computers, Communications and the
Public Interest, pages 40-41, Martin Greenberger, ed., The Johns Hopkins
Press, 1971.)_
