[John Maeda taking over the presidency of RISD][1], [“ambient awareness” being
talked about in the NYT][2], and [all the noise][3] [about chrome][4] all have
a lot to do with one another. If it isn't as obvious to you I'll try to put
more coherent thoughts together in the near future, but for now some of the
highlights:

> Each little update — each individual bit of social information — is
insignificant on its own, even supremely mundane. But taken together, over
time, the little snippets coalesce into a surprisingly sophisticated portrait
of your friends’ and family members’ lives, like thousands of dots making a
pointillist painting. This was never before possible, because in the real
world, no friend would bother to call you up and detail the sandwiches she was
eating. The ambient information becomes like “a type of E.S.P.,” as Haley
described it to me, an invisible dimension floating over everyday life. [#][2]

> "A designer is someone who constructs while he thinks, someone for whom
planning and making go together," says Mr. Maeda, cocking his head, widening
his eyes, moving his hands as if he were shaping a pot. Mr. Maeda considers
himself post-digital; he has outgrown his fascination with hardware and is
driven by ideas. "I want to reform technology. All the tools are the same;
people make the same things with them. Everyone asks me, 'Are you bringing
technology to RISD?' I tell them, no, I'm bringing RISD to technology."

...Mr. Maeda's plan is "to make a justifiable case for creativity in the
world." He wants to shatter the stereotype of the starving artist and show how
RISD makes the case for the entrepreneurial artist. "People fall into a
spectrum about how commercial they want to be, and that's perfect. I just want
to give students the tools to engage in the larger world and at the same time
remain honest to what RISD has been." It remains to be seen whether RISD
students can write computer programming the way they create sculpture -- and
whether they even want to. [#][1]
