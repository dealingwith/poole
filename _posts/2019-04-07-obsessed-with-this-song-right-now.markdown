I don't know what it is about _Down and Out of Time_. I have been a fan of Sixpence None the Richer since their second record, but lost track of them after their third (their popular self-titled, the one with _Kiss Me_ on it). This is their fourth record, which somehow just now crossed my desk 18 years after its release.

I don't know if it's the melody, the lyrics (which I don't really get), the guitar tone (I am a sucker for that kind of lead guitar tone), the bass line, the grace notes on the snare drum...or all of the above.

I've scoured the internet trying to find out more about this song, but only found [this](https://www.popmatters.com/sixpencenonethericher-divine-2496081386.html "pure pop genius") effusive review of the record on PopMatters which states the song is one of only two on the record written by Leigh Nash, and is "about a longing to be needed".

I found the chords, printed out the lyrics and quickly learned the tune. Of course I have issues hitting a couple of the notes as I am, surprise, no Leigh Nash. But it's still a fun song to play. I haven't picked up my guitar in a long time. My fingers hurt.

I've been listening to the entire record quite a bit. It is really good, possibly their best. It's guitar-based pop, from before pop was stolen from those holding guitars.
