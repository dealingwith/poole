(Links to mp3's used to be here. Snooze ya lose.) Beautiful Change. Martha
Avenue Love Song. One For Sorrow, Two For Joy. Look For Me As You Go By.

[![][1]This record][2] has been kinda my theme record for the last month. More
so earlier on, Beautiful Change, I recently realized, having happened almost
immediately, even pre-present-historically, slightly hampered by severe guilt.

Anyway, I had a lot more to say that again will not be typed, these are songs
that were going to go on the mix I mentioned a month ago that is not going to
happen (it was titled "Stabbing Yourself in the Chest," which I spent the week
following the promise-of-said-mix trying not to do {clearly I was either
successful or employed a very good substitute to keep my online persona
alive}). I even had a post with at least the lyrics included, but lost it to a
sidebar hijack by another page. If you really want, you will download, let
these songs soak into your being, and if required, look up the lyrics
yourself. I'm debating trying to get in touch with the IM while I'm only an
hour away from where they live.

And concerning the last song: the Pennsylvania skies have been far from gray,
they have been full of sunshine and clean, cool air.
