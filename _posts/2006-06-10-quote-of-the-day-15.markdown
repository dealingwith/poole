_...and yeah, being rich is easy. we're rich already. we can hire singing
polar bears, start companies, ride in hot air balloons, and eat chilean sea
bass. that's rich! but at the same time, these are small potatoes compared to
building cities, starting cults, supporting an art scene, exporting babies,
and having our own television show. there are some big potatoes out there, if
only we can imagine ourselves in the big potato shoes._ [#][1]
