_More importantly, one must recognize that there are limits to what powers the
federal government should exercise in a crisis. Yes, it is the right and duty
of the president to override state drug policy, to determine who can or cannot
marry, to indefinitely detain citizens without due process and to torture and
kill prisoners as he sees fit, but disaster relief is a matter that should be
left to the states. Yes, the images of the drowned, the diseased, and the
desperately dying drove much of the country to outrage, but how much more
outraged would America have been if FEMA had fed the Superdome refugees
without the full oversight and authorization of the State of Louisiana? Had
the president sent rescue helicopters to evacuate New Orleans the day the
levees burst, he might have saved thousands of lives, but he would also have
overstepped his authority - and if there's one thing George W. Bush refuses to
countenance, it is abuse of power._
