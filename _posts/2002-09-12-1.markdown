<a href="tt.gif"><img src="tt.gif" height="213" width="150" align="left" border="1"></a>Yesterday's piece was truly postmodern: neither element was original.

The image was a complete take on <a href="http://www.newyorker.com">New Yorker's</a> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/covers/?011008on_onlineonly01">Sept 24, 2001 cover</a> by Art Spiegelman. I never saw the original magazine, but I heard about it during (I think) <a href="http://www.npr.org/ramfiles/me/20020904.me.06.ram">this NPR piece</a> (no HTML, link can <a href="http://www.npr.org/news/specials/091102reflections/year_since.html">found here</a>).

The words, in case you live in a pop culture bubble, are from <a href="http://www.u2.com/">U2's</a> song, <a href="http://www.u2.com/lyrics/lyrics_p/lyrics.html">Peace on Earth</a>.

<b>Update</b>: There are <a href="http://www.popexpo.net/eMain.html">a lot of people in the world today</a>. 4 of them visited my site yesterday. No, 2 or 3. 1 or 2 of those were me. And I know who one of the other 2 was. I can guess the last one. This is why I never had a site meter, dammit! And while I wanted to say FU to everyone else, and leave yesterday's install a gift to 2, I realized today that I didn't go to anyone else's site yesterday either. So I shall cast no stone, post this link, and then go wallow in my deepening depression.

<a href="index.html.sep">Here's yesterday's version of the site, danielsjourney.</a>

<b>Update2</b>: I forgot to mention, for non-tech types, if you have 800x600 screen resolution, hit F11 (fullscreen) to see the entire image. F11 again brings u back to normal.

<b>Update3</b>: Thanks to all who emailed to tell me they visited the site 9/11! It seems my counter was a bit off! cool. I'm not depressed anymore, either (but for other reasons!)...
