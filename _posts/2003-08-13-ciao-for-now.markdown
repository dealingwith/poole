Not something I normally blog, but I have to disappear for a while. I don't really want to leave ya'll hangin' on how the gigs go, but I don't orchestrate these timings, unfortunately.



I've had this impending sense of doom since <s>about the second week after</s> before we moved here, actually, and last night it went from being just a dark cloud overhead to me feeling the first raindrops. 



I'll try to get the paypal links for the record up eventually, but if I don't, forgive me, maybe it'll leak on P2P.



also never fixed this site. the spirit of tech has seemed to have left me. not good.



{also sorry for not finishing my "art of the summer..." series, but suffice it to say: donnie darko, donnie darko, donnie darko}



fuck the money, fuck me, fuck it all! woot!



lithium can be sent to the address above.
