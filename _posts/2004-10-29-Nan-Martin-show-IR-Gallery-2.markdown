This particular group of three pieces is one of the most amazing things I've seen. I'm so stoked to have them hanging in my "living room" for the month. You'll get a better idea of their scale on down the page here. If you have $10k you can have them hanging in your living room, permanently. If I had $10k, I would own them already. Why the f* don't you people with $10k already own these? Everyone I know is wondering this.
