[St. Vincent 7][3]

Originally uploaded by [inmemoryofradio][4]

If for some inconceivable reason you missed the [lullabyes.net][5] posts of
St. Vincent, [live in Denton on the opening night of her first headlining tour
in support of her new record, "Marry Me"][6], and [at the Museum of Modern
Arts in Fort Worth][7], both from last year, there they are.


If you need a good tool to snag all the mp3's w/o the right-clicking I
recommend [DownThemAll][8] for Firefox.
