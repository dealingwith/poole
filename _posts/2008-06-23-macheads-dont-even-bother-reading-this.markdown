Just got my new work laptop set up in record time thanks to:

  * Firefox (of course). Thanks to our benevolent Google overlords, so much is
in teh cloud that I'm most of the way there with a browser window.

  * [Digsby][1], for all IM client needs, including GTalk and my work-specific
Jabber account. Plus a Twitter client. Digsby stores everything in the cloud
so there's no re-configuration. Just install, login, and done.

  * [Eclipse][2] ([the PHP version][3]), which doesn't even have an installer.
Just runs.

  * [XAMPP][4], which I discovered upon setting up my new personal laptop two
weeks ago has improved greatly and now installs Apache and MySQL (and
FileZilla server if you want) as services like a breeze and then has a tiny
little "control center" running in the tray in case you need to stop/start
/check-up-on anything.

That's all I really need to get to work. There are a few other minor things,
[FileZilla][5] client to pull down a fresh copy of the site I'm working on,
and eventually I'll need to install [Tortoise SVN][6] to pull down and/or
manage (all mine are a mess at the moment) all the various repositories I work
with, but that's really about it. Being a work machine, Office came pre-
installed, so I'm using Outlook for the work IMAP account (if I could pull
that into Gmail I would, believe me, but it still beats Thunderbird).

The only thing I failed to mention above is Photoshop, which is both the
beefiest application on my must-haves list, and the only one that's not free!
