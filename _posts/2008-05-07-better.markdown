[Getting happy][3] something I'm also doing well on, helps with this one. Just
yesterday I had the thought, "I used to have this real reputation for being an
asshole. I just don't feel that anymore." What's funny is I then had to re-
assess [my commitment to Sparkle Motion][4] but I remembered [this post][5]
where I'm all, "I care about art _too much_," which out of context is just
hilarious. All that to say, seems like in my experience it seemed that being
an asshole is was required to be a doer. Now, in a nice convergence of happy,
content, immediate, and secure, I have more peace about whatever is to come.
I'm in a bit of a restructuring phase, doing a lot of planning, but when the
time comes there will be lots of winning without having to plow anyone over on
the way. So there.

See more progress on: [be nicer][6]
