[this guy committed suicide a long time ago and his blog is still up][1].



in much lighter news, i'm going by "George" for the summer. please refer to me
only as "George" through at least August (timeframe may be extended at my
discretion). if i act confused or don't respond right away, please be patient
and understand that it will take me a little while to get used to it as well.
