So I know I once said I wouldn't post this week, but I did, just kept it to myself for a while, and if you happen upon this then great. Something to read over the weekend while I'm very much away from the computer.



Peace, godspeed, and love and may we always meet again, in person, cyberspace, or heaven, whichever comes first.
