<a href="https://vimeo.com/15091562">Homemade Spacecraft</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user3539560">Luke Geissbuhler</a>

On one hand, this is just an awesome video of an awesome project.

On the other hand, it churned up feelings of helplessness. The first-person view of the unstoppable ascent, it reminded me of how fast and hard my heart fell, and how lightheaded I became, when I got that phone call in the lobby of [LAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport "Los Angeles International Airport"), having just landed 15 minutes prior. Even as I ran across the airport to buy and board a flight back to Dallas, what was happening was an impossibility.

On the other hand, seeing the Earth from that vantage point, it is easier to understand just how small we are. It's a view that speaks to our greatest hope and strength--that Margot is in a better place, and for all our turmoil and pain, she has its equal in peace and love and understanding.
