I remember the last time I got sick and it was YEARS ago. Either 2000 or 2001.
Wish I hadn't broken my record all by my lonesome here tomight. Although maybe
better this way then with witnesses. Still in bad shape but better. A bit
better. Starsailor is definately good music for this state. Soft. Definately
not too loud. Writing here is keeping me together in the meantime even though
I can't see the screen.
