> Icetruck.tv looks like a normal Youtube knockoff at first glance. It has
friendly soft blue icons with rounded edges that just scream, "let's watch
dramatic chipmunks all day long." But beneath the unsuspecting veneer lies one
of the greatest viral marketing campaigns to hit the internet since Al Gore
invented it so long ago.


The Icetruck site is actually a webvertisment for Showtime's Dexter, about a
serial killer who works as a forensic analyst to help catch murderers. If that
doesn't sound cool enough, it stars Michael C. Hall from Six Feet Under. What
more do you need?
