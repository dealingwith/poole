[Twitter][1] on Tuesday, in a preview of whatâ€™s to come in the realm of

[Breaking news, Twitter style][4]


What is so interesting about Twitter is what it is further exposing about what
the web has been showing us for the last 15 years, that is a social experience
of hyperconnectedness, attention, and most of all, mediation.
