![][1]My friend [Wood][2] is the editor for [SCM][3]'s Movement magazine.
[While I was visiting him last year][4] (I think that's when it was), he asked

I'm actually slated to do two more, and the request is I continue this thread.
I have no idea how I'm going to do that, but I have three weeks to figure it
out!
