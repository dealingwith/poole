Lucy turned 15 months 10 days ago, which means it's about time for her 14 month photos to hit the internet. Momma is a busy photographer, besides which, Lucy is a demanding little red bear. So in case you missed it, [here is the set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/carissabyers/sets/72157632957074285/with/8544200370/) and [here is Carissa's post](http://carissabyers.blogspot.com/2013/03/fourteen-months.html). These two are my favs:

I love her eyes in the second one. It's like seeing the future.
