[As mentioned](/2018/11/10/sick-and-tired-of-being-sick-and-tired/), I've been watching more television while sick for the last 2.5 weeks. Most recently I've been watching a lot of _Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee_. It's like living vicariously, but instead of their money, success and charisma, I'm after their ability to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee with their health intact. My mornings are so fraught with coughing fits that I can't really enjoy consuming anything, even my blessed morning coffee. 

Another strange experience while watching the show: the first few episodes I watched made me like Jerry Seinfeld more (_hey this guy is really respectful of his peers_), and each subsequent episode since those first few has made me like him slightly less (_no, he's kind of a low-grade asshole_). But I continue to watch the show. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
