> The web site of [Branislav Kropilak][3] now features larger scale images of
the beautiful parking garages series, and the stunning billboards series of
photographs.


...I am increasingly becoming convinced that there is more truth in these
'found' architectures than any of the works that feature in contemporary
architectural magazines...these images invite us to consider the signs
themselves as pure structure, signifying nothing but themselves.

I'm always fascinated with anything that can recontextualize objects without
actually moving them or adding to them.
