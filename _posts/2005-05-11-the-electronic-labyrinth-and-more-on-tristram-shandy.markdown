[The Electronic Labyrinth is a study of the implications of hypertext for creative writers looking to move beyond traditional notions of linearity][1].

[Time Line][2].

I had very briefly blogged a link to the Tristram Shandy page of the above site, but apprently never followed the rabbit hole upwards. *Excellent* resource.

More on Tristram Shandy / Laurence Sterne:

highest quality images [here][9].

finally some obvious links: [wikipedia entry for Tristram][10] and [Sterne][11].

> One of the meta-statements Sterne seems to be making is he has no respect for your time, nor your desire for narrative cohesion--and why should he? Defiant, Sterne is. Very defiant. Cool. [#][15]
