[The Electronic Labyrinth is a study of the implications of hypertext for
creative writers looking to move beyond traditional notions of linearity][1].


[Time Line][2]



![][3]I had [very briefly blogged a link to the Tristram Shandy page][4] of
the above site, but apprently never followed the rabbit hole upwards.
*Excellent* resource.



More on Tristram Shandy / Laurence Sterne:


[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gent. (1759-67) (complete text
online)][5].


[SparkNotes: Tristram Shandy][6].


[tristramshandyweb.it][7] (don't worry mostly in english...very academic and
thorough)


![][8]


highest quality images [here][9].


finally some obvious links: [wikipedia entry for Tristram][10] and
[Sterne][11], and via that, an [upcoming film version][12], a [1.1M ZIP of the
illustrated hypertext of the books][13].


![][14]


> [#][15] One of the meta-statements Sterne seems to be making is he has no
respect for your time, nor your desire for narrative cohesion -- and why
should he? Defiant, Sterne is. Very defiant. Cool.

Eat yer heart out [David Foster Wallace][16].
