[Flarf][1]: _A quality of intentional or unintentional "flarfiness." A kind of
corrosive, cute, or cloying, awfulness. Wrong. Un-P.C. Out of control. "Not
okay."_

Flarf (2): _The work of a community of poets dedicated to exploration of
"flarfiness." Heavy usage of Google search results in the creation of poems,
plays, etc., though not exclusively Google-based. Community in the sense that
one example leads to another's reply-is, in some part, contingent upon
community interaction of this sort. Poems created, revised, changed by others,
incorporated, plagiarized, etc., in semi-public._

Flarf (3) (verb): _To bring out the inherent awfulness, etc., of some pre-
existing text._

Flarfy: _To be wrong, awkward, stumbling, semi-coherent, fucked-up, un-P.C. To
take unexpected turns; to be jarring. Doing what one is "not supposed to do."_
