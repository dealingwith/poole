I just wrote the best thing I've ever written, into Blogger of all places, and Blogger bombed and I lost it. My only consolations for this short bus maneuver are 1. I had no idea it was going to be the best thing I'd ever written when I started (and now, without a record, I'll never know if it really was) and 2. This has happened to a LOT of other people.



Mental note: somehow stop using Blogger entirely.



Also, if Ev ever tries to say they are not running IIS on M$ machines, <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/003780.php" title="He doesn't quite say it though: ~As for the brilliant analysis that it was due to M$ software, I'm sure you're very educated on these things but...well, you're wrong.~">he is lying</a>. {I was going to grab a screenshot of the IIS error I got, but I forgot. Something about overloading the server. Hmm.}
