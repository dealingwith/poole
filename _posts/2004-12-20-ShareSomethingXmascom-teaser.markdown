*Everything* gets pushed back, so it seems. Code refuses to fall together quickly, bodies refuse to run without sleep...



The book, SWIM Beta, and a bunch of new recordings I've either cut myself or engineered, they're all going to have to wait until January or February. ShareSomethingXmas was originally set to roll last week, but we've decided to make it the first installment of <a href="http://integrationresearch.org">our</a> 12 days of Christmas, starting on the first day of Christmas, December 25.



Every day for 12 days we're going to be discussing something about sharing, gift, technology, social software, culture, etc. We would love if you took part in this meme, so I'm giving you a few days warning. You can copy one of our posts verbatim, just link to one of our posts, or spin off the whole thing and go on a tangent. Whatever.



What else are you going to blog about this time of year? Fruitcake and eggnog?
