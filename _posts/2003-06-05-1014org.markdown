<blockquote>For me, coding is a form of self-expression. 



It's probably the form I'm most effective at.



Everything I code is arguably owned by the company. 



The company controls what I do with my code [in the past, it seemed I had freedom, but it turns out all of that was not really the case--rather, I was somehow avoiding the control illicitly (for 4 years)]



The company controls the most effective means of self-expression I have. 



This is unacceptable to me as an individual, therefore I must leav.

But I'm feeling pretty good, though like usual feeling misunderstood. I'll try to clear it up next week.



At Ian's suggestion been listening to Slint a bit. Good shit. So funny that one of the guys from Slint is now in Zwan, and Zwan sucks so hard. Well, they rule as musicians, but their songs suck. I don't want to listen to christian rock.



...Yesterday driving home I listened to Lamb - Zero a couple times. Such a good song. So simple. Mmmm.</blockquote><a href="http://www.1014.org/">ref</a>
