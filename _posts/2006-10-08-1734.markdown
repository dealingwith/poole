See more progress on: [I am finding where I fit. The answer is revealing
itself to me. When I discover it, success will come easier and more often.][1]

this is possibly the best goal i've put into 43 things. i get an email
reminder every week. it's more an affirmation, right? i got it from [Patrick
Combs][2] ...whose [coaching][3] i'm currently employing (just the intro
level…mental note: $1 trials work!). there's something weird about new agey
types and services…they seem to work! anyhoo…bottom line is i'm thinking about
slowly transitioning all my 43 things to more affirmation-like statements,
then getting the weekly reminder. i quite like it. the coaching audio i just
listened to was about gratitude i think i might add that presently.
