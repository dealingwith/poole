See more progress on: I am finding where I fit. The answer is revealing itself to me. When I discover it, success will come easier and more often.

this is possibly the best goal i've put into 43 things. i get an email reminder every week. it's more an affirmation, right? i got it from ...whose coaching i'm currently employing (just the intro level...mental note: $1 trials work!). there's something weird about new agey types and services...they seem to work! anyhooâ€¦bottom line is i'm thinking about slowly transitioning all my 43 things to more affirmation-like statements, then getting the weekly reminder. i quite like it. the coaching audio i just listened to was about gratitude i think i might add that presently.
