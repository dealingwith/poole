I don't have much to add to this at the moment, although given my current
involvement with [the real-time web][1] obviously I have some thoughts on the
matter, but I found [this analysis of how social applications are built in
contrast to how action-oriented Google applications are built][2] to be rather
interesting, particularly this part as it relates to real-time features:

> Quora is a dozen people running dozens of experiments in how to optimally
use bacn to get people to return to Quora, and how to use toast to keep them
there. Bacn is email you want but not right now, and Quora has 40 flavors of
it that you can [order][3]. Quora's main use of Bacn is to sizzle with
something delicious (a new answer to a question you follow, a new Facebook
friend has been caught in the Quora lobster trap, etc.) to entice you to come
back to Quora. Then, once you're there, the toast starts popping. [Quora
shifts the content to things you care about and hides things you don't care
about][4] in real-time, and subtly pops up notifications while you're playing,
to entice you to keep sticking around and clicking around. Some toast is so
subtle it doesn't even look like a pop-up notificationâ€”it just looks like a
link embedded in the page with some breadcrumbs that appear in real-time to
take you to some place on Quora it knows you'll find irresistible. For every
user's action, bacn's and toast's fly out to others in search of reactions.
(Aside: if I were Twitter, I would be worried. Real-time user interfaces are
more addictive than pseudo-real-time interfaces; what if Quora took all of its
technology and decided to use it to build a better Twitter?) **Social apps are
action-reaction interaction loops; Google apps are designed just for action.**
