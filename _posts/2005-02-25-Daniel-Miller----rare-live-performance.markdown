<s>I</s> supposedly <s>have a gig Sunday night at <a href="http://www.standardandpours.com/">Standard and Pours</a> at South Side on Lamar. I'm heading over there 'round 7. Probly going on sometime 8-9. Hope to see you there.</s>



Gig cancelled. Had the premonition. If you want to hear me play, just swing by IR Gallery. Will probly be in the mood to bang out some tunes. Call first though, probly doing my regular Sunday dinner at the Semrad's. Might go somewhere to watch the Oscars.
