I haven't talked much (or at all) about M's health here because, well, frankly, talking about it here doesn't help any...

...but it has been bad this whole time. We tried all that we knew to try, have become irrevocably disillusioned with the western medical system/field, and just try to cope day-to-day. It is as bad as <a href="index.php?archive=$file&id_pass=01">when we went to the hospital</a>, never really got better but for a week whe was on tons of steroids, and that obviously isn't a long-term answer. So we still just wait, hopeless, a faith not out of faith but out of lack-of-options, wills broken, mostly just clinging to what life is left, dreaming, fantasizing about how perfect life would be without It. And of course it wouldn't be perfect, but it would sure seem like it.
