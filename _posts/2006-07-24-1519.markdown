> Landis, who began his career as a 15-year-old mountain-bike racer was long
known as a solid bike handler and quite adept at popping wheelies on his road
bike in later years.

Asked if he had followed points jersey winner Robbie McEwen's lead on Sunday
and ridden a wheelie down the famed cobbles of the Champs Élysées, the 30
-year-old Landis demurred.

"No," he said. "One broken hip is enough."

[Landis hopes to get surgery done and over quickly][1]
