First off, hello from Ubuntu! I just got Jekyll running on here. [It wasn't hard](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/). I also didn't maintain my Sublime Text settings, so I found a new theme and I really like it. It's [ayu-mirage](https://github.com/dempfi/ayu). New is good.

Today has been [Bandcamp Friday](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-naacp-ldf-fundraiser) and I've spent a lot of time today discovering new music. I just found [Owen](http://owenmusic.bandcamp.com/). Incredible music and every record is name-your-own-price. I'm buying (almost) all of his vast catalog.

I started a new job this week. More on that at a later date.

At new job we write daily summaries of what we worked on. Starting on day two, I started titling my posts.

> Manifesto Hot Sauce

> Conway's Law

> You BETter Shape Up

I plan on writing a _really great title_ for my first week's summing-up but haven't yet.
