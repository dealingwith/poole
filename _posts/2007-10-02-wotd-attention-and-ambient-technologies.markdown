[Ambiently][1]. Is not really a form of the word. But I just used it in an
internal company message. I've posted before about how Twitter is "ambient
text" (I did not come up with that) and the idea of web technologies as
"ambient technologies" interests me so. I consider Facebook to be closer to
the ambient. (MySpace closer to the vomit-on-your-face.) (An interesting
comparison situation given they sort-of-kind-of are there to achieve the same
thing.) Attention and ambient technologies is a huge thing at the moment as we
imagine the future of our industries, societies, and cultures. are you going
to get back to me about [that article][2]? It's stewing.
