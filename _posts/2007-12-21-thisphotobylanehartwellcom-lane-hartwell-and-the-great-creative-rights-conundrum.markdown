[![][1]][2]

It all started a while back when [Lane Hartwell got frustrated][3]. [Friends
spoke up on her behalf][4].

At some point she called a lawyer and enacted the [DMCA][5] on the offending
party's asses. See [Misunderstanding Copyright Law And Ruining Everyone's
Fun][6] and/or [My statement regarding the Richter Scales "Here comes another
bubble" video dispute][7].

So there was some [mainstream media coverage][8], and of course the [bloggers
sang along][9] [like a gospel choir][10]. Some [offered "easy" solutions][11].

[Finally, she just sent an invoice][12]. [And the video was remade without her
photograph included][13].

Early on in all this, I bought [thisphotobylanehartwell.com][2]. I've been
tracking and writing about the situation in a friends-only post, but in the
end, less is more.

So go over to [lanehartwell.com][2], er, I mean
[thisphotobylanehartwell.com][2]. It is customizable so that whenever you need
to provide attribution to someone you can do it in [really big text][14].
