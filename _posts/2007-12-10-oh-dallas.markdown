[Don't][2] [be][3] [silly][4]. [It's ok][5]. Expectations are at an all-time
low. Please, continue. Symbolic identity structures are at stake!

Let's try a different reading of [this][6]:

> He said: "Signs are formed from language, but not the one you think you
know."

_There is no language without deceit._

I realized I had to free myself from the images which in the past had
announced to me the things I sought: only then would I succeed in
understanding the language of Hypatia.

...And when my spirit wants no stimulus or nourishment save music, I know it
is to be sought in the cemeteries: the musicians hide in the tombs; from grave
to grave flute trills, harp chords answer one another.

> Only a saint in his asceticism might find jouissance that is not linked to
the big Other. But there are no gallery openings for a saint's performance.
