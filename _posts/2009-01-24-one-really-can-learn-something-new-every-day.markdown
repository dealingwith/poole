[Boilermaker (beer cocktail)][1]:

> In another variant (popular in and around Hannover, Germany, there called
"LÃ¼ttje Lage"), the shot glass is held rim-to-rim to the far side of the beer
glass as seen from the drinker, and then both are poured into the mouth
simultaneously. The inability of "beginners" and people who are already drunk
to do this without pouring most of the liquid over their faces is good fun for
everybody else to watch.
