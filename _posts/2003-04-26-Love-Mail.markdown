I normally do not do this, put stuff from your emails on my site, but this was so great, and I think part of the idea was for me to help make the announcement. Links added by me for your benefit:<blockquote>Hi Daniel. I am a friend of <a href="http://www.billcarter.cc/">Bill Carter</a>'s, and this morning he sent me the <a href="http://www.danielsjourney.com/index.php?archive=blog_2003_01_06.xml&id_pass=122">link</a> to your web-site. Very nice! Bill is one of my "personal role models" as well. Like you, I was pretty much oblivious to what was happening in Bosnia at the time...two babies in diapers, the daily struggle to keep food in their mouths, and a roof over our head. That all changed in 2001 when I saw <a href="http://www.billcarter.cc/film.html">Miss Sarajevo</a> for the first time, and met Bill. Last summer Bill gave me the manuscript of his book Where Water Comes Together to read. It rocked my world. I am happy to say that <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/">Doubleday</a> has purchased the publishing rights to the book, and Bill is busy editing it. Hopefully, it will be available in bookstores soon! 



Anyway, I just wanted to let you know we both enjoyed your web-site, and will continue to check in.



Cheers!
