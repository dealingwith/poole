**Bitch-Slap** You are 42% Rational, 14% Extroverted, 57% Brutal, and 28%
Arrogant.

You are the Bitch-Slap, the hallmark response of any abusive husband! You are
more intuitive than others, focusing more on feelings than rational
explanations, and you are also probably very brutual because you care more
about yourself than the well-being of others. As most of us know, brutality
combined with emotion often leads to BITCH-SLAPPING, which is why you are
called "The Bitch Slap". (This does not mean you are emotional, only that you
are more affected by emotions than rationality when making decisions.) Another
trait you possess is that you are very humble, which could mean you are
insecure because very few people are brutal AND humble. Not only that, but you
are also rather introverted, and any tendencies towards brutality you possess
may also result from the fact that you bottle up your emotions and don't show
them to others until you explode in rage. Most likely, however, you are not a
VIOLENT person, just someone who is rather selfish. At any rate, being a
bitch-slap does not necessarily mean you will abuse your spouse; it only means
you are rather intuitive, uncaring toward others, brutal, introverted, and
possibly insecure.

**To put it less negatively:**

_1. You are more INTUITIVE than rational. _

_2. You are more INTROVERTED than extroverted. _

_3. You are more BRUTAL than gentle. _

_4. You are more HUMBLE than arrogant._

**Compatibility:**

Your exact opposite is the [Braggart][1].

Other personalities you would probably get along with are the [Schoolyard
Bully][2], the [Class Clown][3], and the [Brute][4].

_If you scored near fifty percent for a certain trait (42%-58%), you could
very well go either way. For example, someone with 42% Extroversion is
slightly leaning towards being an introvert, but is close enough to being an
extrovert to be classified that way as well. Below is a list of the other
personality types so that you can determine which other possible categories
you may fill if you scored near fifty percent for certain traits._
