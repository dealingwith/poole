<i>elevator stories</i>

sometimes when u get in the elevator, there is an invisible person there. u can't see them, but u can <i>smell</i> them. their names are Brut and Calvin Klein, Liz Claiborne and Drakkar. even tho u can't see these people, u can almost tell what race, sex and age they are. 30-something african-american man. 23 yr old white woman. middle-aged white man. 

all these invisible people have two things in common: bad taste and bad (sense of) smell.
