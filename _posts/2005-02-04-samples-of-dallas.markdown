From the current Dallas Observer:

> Should you find yourself at IR Gallery from 7 pm to 9 pm Saturday, admiring one of Hal Samples' photographs and on the fence about purchasing said piece, here's a word of advice. Four, actually: Give until it hurts. Why? Because that's what Samples has been doing since he began his Hero to Zero project, which raises money and awareness for the local homeless community...Samples' vision is altruistic in front of the camera and artistic behind it, imbuing his start images of the people and places that populate this world inside a world with warmth. Even if there wasn't a good cause involved, the heartfelt photos in his latest show, Samples of Dallas, which runs through February 16, would be worthy additions to anyone's collection.
