No, really, this time it is short...no pictures though...you'll have to wait for someone else to take one.



You know how (for those of us who get our hair cut by women--I've personally never had a guy cut my hair) the best part of getting your hair cut is copping a little bit of head massage when they wash and cut your hair? Well here in Bosnia, they spend a little bit extra time rubbing in that conditioner. I was like Oh God. Nothing weird or anything, but I hadn't been touched like that in...well, a while.
