> Many of Muse's albums, most notably Origin of Symmetry, have revolved around
strange and often cryptic messages, sent by the band in a variety of ways.

While they toured the U.S. in 2005, Muse left a long-running series of cryptic
titles in their setlists, as alternate names for their new songs. These
cryptic names turned out to be a series of anagrams. The Internet forums
flared up, full of fans trying to solve the anagrams and figure out what they
pointed towards. Finally, a lucky few fans figured out what they had to do:
one of the anagrams ("cold aqua tomato") pointed to an email address (which is
no longer active), while others gave details of passwords and subject
headings. A mere thirteen people worked this out, and received replies from
the band that pointed to a prize: a bicycle locked up in the U.S., its
location and the combination to unlock it.

Muse created what seemed to be a giant treasure hunt, and in their future
setlists more anagrams pointed towards more complicated methods of decryption,
caesar squares and the use of an M-3 Enigma naval simulator. A second wave of
fans complied to the demands of the clues, which involved writing the password
on their bodies and including a picture in the email, and this time only four
people were successful in getting a reply. [6]

More recently, Muse's manager, Tom Kirk, has posted messages on behalf of the
band on their forums alluding to the progress of the forthcoming album in a
very indirect and cryptic way.[7] As details emerge about the record, it has
only then become apparent what parts of these messages referred to.

i was just randomly listening to [Muse][1] (don't even know which record this
is) and wondered what was up with them. never really followed them
whatsoever...i think i DL'd this record back in the Napster days. anyhoo,
reading that bit above instantly made me a huge fan...

list.
