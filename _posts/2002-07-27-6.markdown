<s><i>"we don't need no bridges, let the mother-fuckers burn!"</i>

...not that there was one anyway...

So, apparently our term <a href="hatemail.html">installation</a> has been <a href="http://whatischurch.com/weblog/">co-opted</a>. *@#$. Time to think of new terminology. In some cases, imitation is not flattery...

At least no one so smiley-Jesus-y would ever use the name <a href="http://christianpornmachine.com">christian porn machine</a>

And one more thing while I'm being a nasty asshole, <a href="http://whatischurch.com/weblog/2002_07_01_archive.html#85276354">not finding a house to buy or an apt to lease</a>, or just about any other environmental "hardship" known in this country, is NOT A TRIAL FROM GOD!! There are millions of people who have never had a roof over their head in their lives! (<a href="http://theyblinked.blogspot.com/2002_07_21_theyblinked_archive.html#79487334">ref</a>: two posts ago!) STARVATION, LAND MINES, and CANCER are TRIALS and "not much fun."

Just a friendly reminder to Americans everywhere...
