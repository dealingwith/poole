<b>update:</b> figured out these songs tonight--they are remarkably simple, chord structure-wise. just goes to show that that is not what's important! (aside: I notice messed up things in the English language now that I've compared it favorably to Bosnian on a few occations--so "...is not what is..."?? good knight. someone tell me there is a better way.)


For nonmusical types: there are numbered chords in each key, 6 I think, you can throw other chords in there for good measure if you want, but basically you work around those six a vast majority of the time. 
SO, the two Dove's songs are both in the same key (commmon--most of my songs are too, in fact, G--1/2 step higher than these, if memory serves), and their chord structures are as follows:


<em>Caught</em> is 5-4-1-5.

<em>Pounding</em> is 1-5-4-1 and 4-5-6-4.


have fun.
