So I had _heard_ of [Listener](http://iamlistener.com/) before my friend and general artist-trickster-social-funambulist [Hal Samples](http://halsamples.com/) started bumming around with [Christin Nelson](http://christinnelson.com/ "Who at the time was part of Listener"), whose record [Red Moon Rising](https://christinnelson.bandcamp.com/album/red-moon-rising "Which I described by starting 'Are you walking into a dusty west Texas town with one hand resting on the butt of your revolver and the other hand resting on the butt of an amazonian woman?'") I immediately fell in love with. Christin recently directed a video for [Krum & Rob Viktum](https://rappersiknow.bandcamp.com/album/bare-knuckle-gospel), which you should watch:

I forget when or how I first heard of Rob Viktum, but I had lost track of his work in recent years. To say I was thrilled to discover his new work through this unexpected path would be an understatement. He also has new work out as [Vik Filthy](https://robviktum.bandcamp.com/album/cold-war-caviar) amongst others. But it did not end there.

_Bare Knuckle Gospel_ is released through [Rappers I Know](http://www.rappersiknow.com/ "a music portal and boutique record label"), the labour of love of [Frank William Miller, Junior](https://fwmj.carbonmade.com/about). RIK is the most wonderful kind of rabbit hole. Magical and trippy and surprising.

The music of RIK is notable for its well-crafted beats, thoughtful lyrics and soul. For some time I have had little-to-no interest in mainstream hip hop. It smells of lazy beats, simpleton lyrics and a lack of soul. But when I find these vast undercurrents of true artistry I get really excited. I've barely scratched the surface of what Mr. Miller [has curated](https://rappersiknow.bandcamp.com/music).

There's even jazz. I will stop now before I begin a treatise on the importance of keeping jazz, soul and hip hop connected.
