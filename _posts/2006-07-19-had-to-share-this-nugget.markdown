from my lunch stopover at Kroger just now:

As I approach the salad bar, there is a big sign above the chicken: a mom,
seated in her minivan, gaggle of chitlins in the back, smiling wide into the
camera. Above her it says: "Ready! Baked! Go!"

in other news, [Wal-mart has hired an EX-nun][1] to help with their public
relations problem.
