Dear CNN,



You are full of shit, and you have shot yourself in the foot. Personally, I gave up on your network during the post-Sept-11 media chaos, mentally grouping you with Fox News and Miami's Channel 7. Kevin's blog, however, was the start of a new respect for your organization, based on the fact that one of your employs had the character and foresight to blog his experience. His blog does not divert from your coverage or distract him from his work--it gives credibility to your service, and completes the narrative arc in a way your super-cheesy achors could never do.
