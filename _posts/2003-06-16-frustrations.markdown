All morning someone has been hammering on the walls in some adjacent apartment. I think it has to be one of them below us, but you know how you can't ever pinpoint such a sound? Yeah, because if I could I would go kick his unholy ass back to Herzegovina.



I'm also trying to figure out what takes 4 hours to hammer.



I also realized how hard making something easy is. I'm trying to create a more simple, intuitive template for you all, but it is hard, let me tell you. I realize now why all the blogging tools so far just store your data in a DB, have a proprietary template format, and dump out HTML.



There is no such thing as the elegant solution in technology.
