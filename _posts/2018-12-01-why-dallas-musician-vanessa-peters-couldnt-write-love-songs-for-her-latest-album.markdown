I was reading [the latest of our friend Vanessa Peters' always lovely email newsletters](https://vanessapeters.fanbridge.com/campaigns/show.php?id=1492144&sid=176587112)...

> I am grateful for this list of things to do. It represents a full life, a life of adundance, and as we get closer to the end of this weird, upside-down year, I am reminded once again how lucky I am to be playing music for all of you.

...and she casually mentions in the postscript that she was [featured in Guide Live](https://www.guidelive.com/music/2018/11/29/dallas-musician-vanessa-peters-couldnt-write-love-songs-latest-album "Why Dallas musician Vanessa Peters couldn't write love songs for her latest album").

> It seemed disingenuous to write love songs when it felt like the world was on fire.

> My songs can be kind of heavy, but I am an optimist at heart. I donâ€™t see any point in lamenting endlessly when there is work to be done.
