>To the sick the doctors wisely recommend a change of air and scenery. Thank Heaven, here is not all the world...

>...we should oftener look over the tafferel of our craft, like curious passengers, and not make the voyage like stupid sailors picking oakum...Our voyaging is only great-circle sailing, and the doctors prescribe for diseases of the skin merely.

_Henry David Thoreau, **Walden**_

I had to look up both _[tafferel](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/taffrail)_ and _[oakum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakum)_.

Have you seen [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/) yet? It's remarkable. Like [200wad](https://200wordsaday.com), it is something on the internet that makes me believe in the world wide web again.
