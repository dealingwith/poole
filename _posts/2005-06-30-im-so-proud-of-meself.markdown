i worked out for the first time since i moved back into country this morning.
ran to the dog park and back, well halfway back before i had to walk; but the
dog was dragging more than i (that dude can sprint like a mothertrucker, but
has like no slow twitch muscles).

anyway, that was a long time w/o working out. i sure hope i stick to it. i
wish i had cable TV and a set of rollers...i'd get my bike set back up and
ride the rollers while watching the Tour in July.
