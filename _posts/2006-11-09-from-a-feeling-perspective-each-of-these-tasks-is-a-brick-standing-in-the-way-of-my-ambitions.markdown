[David Seah : Productivity and Newton's Laws of Motion][1]:

> As I wrote down my lamentations, I noticed the following pattern:

>

>   * Each task is a course of action is comprised of multiple steps.

>   * Each course of action requires one or more creative decisions to be made

>   * Each decision requires the collection, analysis, and synthesis of
information.

>   * The amount of time that the collection, analysis, and synthesis of
information will take is unknown.

>

> From a "feeling" perspective, each of these tasks is a brick standing in the
way of my ambitions, emanating a Ghandi-like ability to subvert my will to
act. There's nothing actively stopping me from doing these things except for
the lack of surety; the moment of decision is hamstrung by my uncertainty of
the time it will take to collect and analyze the supporting data.
