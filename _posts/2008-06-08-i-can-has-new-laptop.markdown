No matter which OS I go with, a computer is as utilitarian as the electric
company that fuels its evil heart, and will never excite me the way a new web
app will. Given that sitting in front of the hardware and interacting with the
OS is where we _actually_ spend most of our time, that is a shame.

From a very high level, I know exactly why all OS's--or all large technology
projects, for that matter--fail, but I don't have many ideas on how to fix
technology on that scale. The same things that make tech interesting are the
things that make it fail so often.

I would tell you the long story of _how_ my old laptop died* and _what_ I did
to try and save it, but** I'm almost done with my coffee and I have to shower
and pack. I'm off to Florida for a few days of working vacation, followed by a
few days of proper vacation.

* technically, only the windows install on a partition on my MacBook failed.
So now it's just a Mac. Which is great. If the only application you need a
computer for is iTunes.

** it's really boring stuff to non-geeks.
