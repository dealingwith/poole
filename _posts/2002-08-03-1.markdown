<i>If you walked into a room during the course of the last ten years while <a href="http://www.overtherhine.com">Over The Rhine</a> was on stage redreaming the world and hoping for a little wideness and wonder or whatever, you may have turned around and walked out or scratched your head or chuckled or stood stock still or elbowed your way closer or maybe the room was mostly empty...This recording is one way of impulsively baking a cake from scratch and throwing a little party before we remember to feign sophistication and reserve. Pull a string, there's a bang and ten years' worth of confetti metaphors fly, landing on the floor a few feet away, or in our hair..</i>

Got two used OtR CD's at the used record store in our neighborhood last night, Amateur and 'Till We Have Faces...
