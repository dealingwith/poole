<i>Scenes from an ordinary, elevated life</i>: 

There's 5 of us. The fat and strangely beautiful woman in rough, turquoise fabrics asks "What floor?"

"14" I say as I slunk into the corner.

The couple next to speaks about something <i>very</i> important.

Guy in the far corner has very large headphones and is reading Rolling Stone.

In the face of humanity you will never have it figured out.
