Margot

I [said](/2011/11/29/desire-and-meaning/ "it is time to stop writing publicly about it in such an explicit manner") I wouldn't blog about it again. I am.

I thought I would be able to look at her pictures and watch her videos by now. I still can't, really.

They say you can't live in the past. You can't leave it behind either, though.

Our friend Darius Holbert wrote a song for Margot soon after her passing and gave it to us. I hung onto it for almost a year, then had it mastered, and now have hung onto it for another year. Today seemed like the right day to let other people hear it. So here it is.

I knew this post would be difficult although I underestimated how difficult. Maybe it's a good thing I'm not drinking for the month of July because I really want a drink right now but that might be a bad idea. Instead I think I'll go cuddle Lucy.
