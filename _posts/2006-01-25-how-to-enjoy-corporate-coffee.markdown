this one's for free, kids:

1. Bring your own creamer**/half-n-half (or whatever) (unless you drink yours
black). Unless of course you like the [chemical burn][1] powder, in which case
you have no need for this checklist in the first place.

2. Use TWO of the little prepackaged grinds things. This is the only-obvious-
once-you-realize-it key.

3. Enjoy.***

*offer void for people who thinks Starbucks is good and/or the only acceptable
brew

**NOT what my last date said

***something sweet also improves the experience. my current guilty pleasure
are white chocolate reese's.
