[CiteULike: Fatal attraction in rats infected with Toxoplasma gondii.][1]

> We tested the hypothesis that the parasite Toxoplasma gondii manipulates the
behaviour of its intermediate rat host in order to increase its chance of
being predated by cats, its feline definitive host, thereby ensuring the
completion of its life cycle. Here we report that, although rats have evolved
anti-predator avoidance of areas with signs of cat presence, T. gondii's
manipulation appears to alter the rat's perception of cat predation risk, in
some cases turning their innate aversion into an imprudent attraction. The
selectivity of such behavioural changes suggests that this ubiquitous parasite
subtly alters the brain of its intermediate host to enhance predation rate
whilst leaving other behavioural categories and general health intact. This is
in contrast to the gross impediments frequently characteristic of many other
host parasite systems. We discuss our results in terms of their potential
implications both for the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis and the neurological
basis of anxiety and cognitive processes in humans and other mammals.
