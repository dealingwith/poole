Lucy thinks she should have a troop of monkeys; it's obvious and inarguable. It wouldn't matter to her if I explained the complications of monkey ownership; how difficult it would be to acquire one, how much they would defecate all over the house, how they would never do what she wanted them to, how much noise they would make, etc; none of that would matter because she can't comprehend anything beyond the thought of having a troop of cute monkeys.Fortunately Lucy won't hold me to the monkeys. But I'm trying to think of what I would do if she did. Probably ignore her. :)
