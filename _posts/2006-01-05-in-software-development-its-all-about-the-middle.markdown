_In most things it's how you start and how you finish that seem to matter
most. What I've come to realize is that in software development it's all about
the middle.

The middle is about morale, motivation, and momentum. It's easy to get excited
when you first start something, and even easier to get excited when you're
about to launch something, but if you can't maintain that excitement during
the doldrums, then you're in deep trouble.

Morale, motivation, and momentum are the most important software development
tools you have â€” more important than software, more important than hardware._
