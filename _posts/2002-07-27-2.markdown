Today I went on my first club ride in Virginia! it was actually a great experience, despite the fact that I couldn't hang on and had to take the short way home. the guys on the team were really nice, waited for me, and told me how to get back. it was a good thing i didn't try to hang on for much longer, because i blew up amazingly! it has been a long time since I rode any hills at all. however, just this one ride renewed my love for actually riding. yesterday as i watched <a href="http://www.letour.fr/">le Tour</a>, I was thinking about how much I love to watch the sport, but not anymore participate. well today proved that wrong. I'm already dreaming of getting back into enough shape to race again, and I'm wondering what the cycling will be like in the country where we are sent...
