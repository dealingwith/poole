There has been a lot of talk about leaving Facebook, something I did two years ago, and I highly recommend. So how does one find online community post-Facebook?

## Email

Good old-fashioned email. There are people I don't see in the course of my regular life, people I (maybe) would have been able to keep up with on Facebook (if the algorithm allowed). I simply email them when I think about them. I find the level of connection exponentially better; maybe because of the infrequency of the communication, but more likely because of the directness and more intimate nature of one-on-one.

## Slack and Discord 

I'm a member of a number of [Slack](https://slack.com/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) groups, not just for work. Some of these are friend groups, most are simply affinity groups. 

## Meetups

[Meetup](http://meetup.com/). There are others. Many have associated Slack or Discord groups. 

## Alternative Social Networks

I was a member of [Uncommon](https://uncommon.cc) for a while. They send you a hand-written postcard when you join.

I'm terrible at getting plugged into or keeping up with [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social), but it is an open, distributed Twitter-like. Same for [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).

## Forums and Forum-like

[Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [spectrum.chat](https://spectrum.chat), [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) (I am currently trying out [Reditr](http://reditr.com/) to save my eyes, hopefully I get the new Reddit design soon) (obviously Reddit can be bad, but you control what you see), [OSMI](https://forums.osmihelp.org/). There are others I'm forgetting.

## RSS

Blogs never went away, and apparently they are making a comeback. I use [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) as my RSS reader of choice. There is also the free [Feedly](https://feedly.com/).

## General Guidelines

There are obvious issues with Facebook and those issues can exist elsewhere. In general it is good to avoid the following:

* Algorithmically displayed or sorted content
* Platforms with socially targeted advertising
* Partisan politics
* Gossip
* Platforms for general complaints
* Platforms used to build brands, corporate or personal
* Platforms built on your personal data (pay attention to what they request when logging in with [OAuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth))

The opposites are generally ok:

* User-defined or sorted content
* Old-fashioned ads
* No random political content
* No gossip or general complaining
* No corporations posing as people or otherwise trying to be "real"
* Lack of desire to know everything about you. Ability to be anonymous is a big plus.
