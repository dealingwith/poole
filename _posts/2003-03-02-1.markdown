<blockquote>I'd like to sit

On a bar stool in heaven

Right next to Christ.



We'd share a jug of beer

And a packet of smokes

(although I doubt he'd inhale)



I think I'd tell him

About fast cars on open roads

8th birthday parties

And Arsenal's disappointing away form

I hope he'd tell me

About his favourite star

Why sheep exist

And how he thought of photosynthesis



By the second jug

We'd move to sit by the fire

Have a couple of cigars

And a packet of peanuts



I think I'd get angry

And ask Him

About rape and HIV and Hiroshima and cot-death

Then he'd get even angrier

And ask Me

About rape and HIV and Hiroshima and cot-death



And then

Then maybe we'd sit quietly

And sup our pints

The fire would burn

The logs would crackle

And the world would turn



After a while I'd tell him a story

He'd tell me a joke

And we'd play a few games of dominoes.</blockquote>I heard this poem read at a <a href="http://www.thedfgcorporation.co.uk/">dfg</a> performance at the last <a href="http://www.greenbelt.org.uk">greenbelt</a> and loved it (along with the rest of their performance which also includes music and drama...tons and tons of high british drama!). I particularly like the "I think I'd get angry..." verse... (via <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~smallritual/">Steve</a>)
