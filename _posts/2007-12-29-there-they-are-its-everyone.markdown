> ...There are balloons taped to the benches, and the girl this person used to
stand next to at the bus stop is waving a streamer. Everyone is smiling. For a
moment this person is almost creeped out by the scene, but it would be so like
this person to become depressed on the happiest day ever, and so this person
bucks up and joins the crowd.

>Teachers of subjects that this person wasn't even good at are kissing this
person and renouncing the very subjects they taught. Math teachers are saying
that math was just a funny way of saying "I love you." But now they are simply
saying it, I love you, and the chemistry and PE teachers are also saying it
and this person can tell they really mean it. It's totally amazing. Certain
jerks and idiots and assholes appear from time to time, and it is as if they
have had plastic surgery, their faces are disfigured with love. The handsome
assholes are plain and kind, and the ugly jerks are sweet, and they are
folding this person's sweater and putting it somewhere where it won't get
dirty.

>Best of all, every person this person has ever loved is there. Even the ones
who got away. They hold this person's hand and tell this person how hard it
was to pretend to get mad and drive off and never come back. This person
almost can't believe it, it seemed so real, this person's heart was broken and
has healed and now this person hardly knows what to think. This person is
almost mad. But everyone soothes this person. Everyone explains that it was
absolutely necessary to know how strong this person was.

Today's mp3s of the day are the live sets by Dan Wilson and Sondre Lerche,
from their Club Dada performances in November, thanks to lullabyes.net (dead link).
