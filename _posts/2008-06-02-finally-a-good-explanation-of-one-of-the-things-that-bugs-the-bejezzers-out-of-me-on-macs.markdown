[Coding Horror: Mouse Ballistics][1]

> So what's wrong with Mac OS X's mouse acceleration curve? Simply put, it's
the wrong shape. For mouse motion to feel natural (at least for most people),
the curve has to start by moving upward fairly moderately, then gradually
flattening out as the value of X increases. Mac OS X's, curve, however, starts
off by being too steep, staying too steep for too long, and then flattening
out too abruptly. In practical terms this means that, frequently, as a user
tries to use the mouse to move the pointer from point A to point B, the
pointer motion feels sluggish. The user then tries to compensate for the
sluggishness by moving the mouse faster, and the pointer suddenly goes flying
across the screen and overshoots point B. A comfortable and useful curve is
actually shaped like a curve. Mac OS X's curve, however, is shaped more like a
cliff.
