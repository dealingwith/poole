[Clinton is MSFT, Obama is Google][1]...

> Clinton is an OS - request a feature and it will be considered, then
prioritized for a four-year release cycle. Obama is an API - if you want
something, build it.

Clinton is the familiar new IBM CEO, appointed by the Board of Directors
because they all sit together on Pepsico's board. Obama is the start-up CEO -
you'll quit your job to be employee #6 because you get to be part of the
solution.
