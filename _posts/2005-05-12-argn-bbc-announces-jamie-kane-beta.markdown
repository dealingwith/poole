I need to just stick [ARGN][1]'s feed on here (any 3rd party tools for that?)


[ARGN: BBC Announces Jamie Kane Beta][2]

> The BBC has announced today that it is accepting beta testers for its
upcoming alternate reality game Jamie Kane. The game is aimed at a teenage
audience and revolves around the search for a missing popstar.


Those who are familiar with alternate reality games may be a little surprised
by the lack of stealth here, but Jamie Kane is treading into new territory in
numerous ways. This game, while employing classic ARG elements, will be aimed
at a primarily teenage market, so the plot and puzzles will be targeted
accordingly. In addition, it won't be played in real-time, so that players may
begin at any time and all have the same experience. Nevertheless, Jamie Kane
will employ numerous websites, emails, mobile phone alerts, videos and instant
messaging to help players discover what happened to their favorite pop-star,
Jamie Kane.


According to Rob Cooper, the head of the BBC's interactive drama and
entertainment department, 'You play for around 20 minutes a day and it makes
use of AI chats to feed you info. Typically, it will take around 15 days to
solve, a clue at a time.'
