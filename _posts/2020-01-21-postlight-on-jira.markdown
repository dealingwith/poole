>RZ: You don’t wanna discourage--like people feeling really productive around a new thing, you don’t wanna be like, “What are you doin’ with one more tool?” Jira showed up on the scene about 60 days ago here. 60-90 days ago. We had kinda been shunning it for--

>PF: Yeah it really did. Everybody suddenly became Enterprise one day...the thing I love about Jira too--it’s been more than 90 days, I think it’s been more like five or six months--I can’t log in.
