> In our case, the programming happens second not first... When...the
programming happens first, design and the user experience are treated as
wallpaper, wall covering, paint, and that's why most products suck, because
the design is bad because it can't be good. It's not allowed to be good, it's
not part of the process from the beginning...

If you have salespeople telling you..."If you just add this one thing this
guy's going to sign up for a million dollar contract." Bullshit...

At some point you just have to be happy with what you're building... You have
to have a vision for the product... What kind of organization do you want to
be? Do you want to trend towards mediocrity by adding everything you could
possibly add [to your product]?

...Cash flow will follow integrity...who wants to go to work every day and
work on shit that's a total mess? No one wants to do that.
