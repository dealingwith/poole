<b>Wrangers are no longer made in the USA</b>!! They very recently closed up shop in El Paso, laying off a bunch of workers and employing contractors in a whole mess of notorious sweatshop countries. <a href="http://www.danielsjourney.com/?archive=blog_2002_12_15.xml&id_pass=79">What I found at Cosco</a> was no doubt that last of the made in the USA stock, being unloaded for the new stock of sweatshop jeans to be stocked in regular retail outlets. Blech!



More info <a href="http://www.rightoutthere.com/articles/wrangler.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.newnation.org/Archives/NNN-Guest-Column-06.html">here</a>. (Thanks Jason!)



Stay tuned for more updates on my quest for non-sweatshop clothing...
