[Just very well articulated is all][2]. This blog may have a lot more of this
kind of stuff on it henceforth, as the threads of hypernarrative, storytelling
as a cultural practice, and the "cultural" bits of commerce and business all
begin to intersect, both in my own experience and within the general trend of
online idea exchange. e.g. the fact that most ARGs are really just marketing
campaigns.


Also, this is one of the sources pulled for [the Sugarfilled feed][3].
