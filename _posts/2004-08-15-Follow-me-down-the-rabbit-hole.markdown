Was reading <a href="http://www.craigclevenger.com/">craigclevenger.com</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1931561486/ref=wl_it_dp/102-9126044-0387335?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=I2J0EQMQGIYXJW&v=glance&colid=1IE1ZRAEO5E1F">The Contortionist's Handbook</a>, which has been optioned for a film. I had known that Donnie Darko writer-director Richard Kelly was slated to direct it (from chuckpalahniuk.net), and you can read Craig's story of that on his site.




What I found from that was <a href="http://www.richard-kelly.net/">richard-kelly.net</a>, from which I found out about <a href="http://www.southlandtales.com/index.html">Southland Tales</a>, Richard's next movie, which begins shooting this fall...Kevin Smith is somehow involved in this film as well.



I also found <a href="http://www.ruinedeye.com/cd/index.htm">Cellar Door</a>, which is a collection of info on Donnie Darko, and on <a href="http://www.ruinedeye.com/cd/dscenes/dsee4.htm">this page about the deleted scenes</a>, I found out about another scene hidden on the DVD.
