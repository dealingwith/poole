Was reading <a href="http://www.craigclevenger.com/">craigclevenger.com</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1931561486/ref=wl_it_dp/102-9126044-0387335?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=I2J0EQMQGIYXJW&v=glance&colid=1IE1ZRAEO5E1F">The Contortionist's Handbook</a>, which has been optioned for a film. I had known that Donnie Darko writer-director Richard Kelly was slated to direct it (from chuckpalahniuk.net), and you can read Craig's story of that on his site.

What I found from that was richard-kelly.net [`dead link`], from which I found out about _Southland Tales_, Richard's next movie, which begins shooting this fall...Kevin Smith is somehow involved in this film as well.

I also found Cellar Door [`dead link`], which is a collection of info on Donnie Darko, and on this page about the deleted scenes [`dead link`], I found out about another scene hidden on the DVD.
