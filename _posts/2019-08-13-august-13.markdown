I write this post every year.

[2016]({{site.baseurl}}/2016/08/13/my-sweet-margot/), [2017]({{site.baseurl}}/2017/08/13/august-13/) and [last year]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/08/13/august-13/) for example.

I don't know exactly what to say this year. We were on vacation in California on her birthday and I forgot all about it. Later I was sad that it had passed me by unnoticed. Today I'm looking at my calendar trying to figure out when I can go put flowers on her grave. I'm so stupid busy these days.

In 2016 I said:

>Today Lucy said, “I wish I had a sister.” I said, “Well, Lucy, someday we will tell you a story.”

We've since told her that story. Lucy cried, and looked at pictures of Margot for a long time, and asked some questions. That day we put Margot's picture on the piano with the rest of the kids. 

My first post on this site about Margot's death was [In Order to Remember We Must First Forget]({{site.baseurl}}/2010/09/02/in-order-to-remember-we-must-first-forget/). It's good to be beyond the forgetting and on to the remembering.
