You scored as **Postmodernist**. Postmodernism is the belief in complete open
interpretation. You see the universe as a collection of information with
varying ways of putting it together. There is no absolute truth for you; even
the most hardened facts are open to interpretation. Meaning relies on context
and even the language you use to describe things should be subject to
analysis.
