_Please do not get me wrong. I am all for chasing your dreams and trying new
ideas. What I am I not for is the quick out. The 18 month exit strategy. Build
something of value. Build something you can point to. Build something to be
proud of. These types of things take time, stress, scarcity, and devotion. But
as in all other areas of life they are the most beautiful._
