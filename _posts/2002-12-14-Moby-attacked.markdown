<i>all of a sudden i was attacked by (i believe) 3 men with mace. they punched me from behind and i really had no idea what was going on. i assumed that a bar-fight had spilled out of the bar and that somehow i had gotten caught in the middle of it. but no. after being punched in the head from behind a few times i turned around to see what was going on and one of them punched me in the face a couple of times and then they all ran away.</i>
