[Derek Powazek - Meaning-Making Machines][5]:

> Recently a researcher named Jennifer Whitson published a study in the
journal Science called “[Lacking Control Increases Illusory Pattern
Perception][6].” She did an experiment with two groups that were given a test.
The “powerless” group was told that their answers were half right, half wrong,
no matter what they said. The “in control” group were told that their answers
were right.

Both groups were then shown a series of images of random static. Here’s the
interesting part: The people in the “powerless” group were more likely to see
images in the static - to find meaning in chaos - than the people in the “in
control” group. So, while all our brains are meaning-making machines, the
results of this study show that stressed out brains work harder to find
meaning. They literally see things that are not there.
