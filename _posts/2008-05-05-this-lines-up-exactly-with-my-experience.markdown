[The Ala Carting of Video on the Net - Will it lead to disaster? - Blog
Maverick][1]:

> **So where does this leave independent video content on the Internet? Right
in the hands of Google and Youtube and black and white hat SEOs.**

The ala carting of video on the net will benefit those who enable the search
for content and can monetize that search. The economics of supporting content
will force independently produced Internet content to be dumbed down to levels
that create a perfect match for Youtube. There will be SEOs that come up with
arbitrage solutions that will drive traffic to parked videos. Content creators
will partner with SEOs and create budgets that reflect the CPMs they can earn
in and around the video hosted on Youtube against the costs of the SEO driving
traffic to the video. SEO support will be the only even marginally effective
way to create baseline traffic to a video/show.

**Who could have guessed that creating financially successful video on the net
would require the same marketing skills as driving traffic to parked
domains?**

[That's pretty much what's happened with my former employer][2], and why
design and [UX][3] don't matter to them. Robots don't care what the page looks
like. And that's the problem when you value statistical growth over _actual
human growth_. But since advertisers value the former, and video production
requires significant capital output, I have no solutions for when revenues are
required very early in a very young market. All I know is no-one expected to
make money with [free open-source browsers][4] or [search][5] either. I see a
near-future convergence in the media industry that includes some market
[attractors][6] that redefine the game and leave a few people very wealthy.
But they will be the people who set themselves up early, putting a lot on the
line to be there when it happens...with actual human audiences.
