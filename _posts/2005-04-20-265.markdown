**You Are 29 Years Old**


29


Under 12: You are a kid at heart. You still have an optimistic life view - and
you look at the world with awe.

13-19: You are a teenager at heart. You question authority and are still
trying to find your place in this world.

20-29: You are a twentysomething at heart. You feel excited about what's to
come... love, work, and new experiences.

30-39: You are a thirtysomething at heart. You've had a taste of success and
true love, but you want more!

40+: You are a mature adult. You've been through most of the ups and downs of
life already. Now you get to sit back and relax.
