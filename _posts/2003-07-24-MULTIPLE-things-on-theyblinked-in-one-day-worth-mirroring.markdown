<blockquote>there is something magical about music. there is also something magical about large groups. together they have real power. listening to the crowd and band singing this entire song, in gang chorus, elicits something very human from me--empathy, camaraderie, passion. there is a psychology of communication that comes into play in any exchange of information. statistically, it is said that people believe something to be more likely true if it rhymes. why? who knows? there is a persuasive efficacy to rhythm and rhyme just as there is to the frenzied ethos of the crowd screaming in unison.</blockquote>

a calling is a luxury
and the artist is seen as either
a fool or a terrorist.</blockquote>
