I briefly mentioned Owen [in this post](/2020/06/19/web-log/). Owen is the solo project of Chicago's Mike Kinsella. He also has a number of other bands, one of which is [American Football](https://americanfootball.bandcamp.com/). It took me another week or so to stop exclusively listening to Owen's latest record and give American Football a listen, but once I did...I can't stop. This record is just everything I like in music.

The clean guitars, the snare drum ghost notes, the layered vocals including the occasional guest female vocalists, sometimes with a brilliant call-and-response style, the mallets, the lyrics. I've been listening to this record most of the time I've been listening to music for the last couple of weeks. I've listened to [their previous release](https://americanfootball.bandcamp.com/album/american-football-lp2) a few times too, but it's really this most recent record that has me.

I need to check out his other projects, too, obviously. But it's been a long time since I've been this enamored with a record.
