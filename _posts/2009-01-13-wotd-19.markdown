Kaleidoscopic.

I was trying to describe a building where the hallways all begin to look the
same after a while, like an old 2D video game. "That building can get
kaleidoscopic."

...courtesy of my coworker, who used to teach math, but I told her: now that I
know she has a great vocabulary, she's in trouble.
