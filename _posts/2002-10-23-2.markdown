<i>Tech:</i> <b>Nation Microsoft</b>

It's really happening. Is there any reason these products can't be less expensive except to maintain the monopoly?

MS reports that they want revenue from MS Office to double--<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,644086,00.asp">to 20 billion clams by 2010</a>. They have <a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/ejournal/4307752.htm">40 million in cash</a>, 7.7 billion in sales just last <b>quarter</b>, and their stock price <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&s=MSFT">has been going up</a>.

Greedy, greedy bastards. Makes me want to just develop my software ideas in Java on a Linux machine. Perhaps it is time. If you have any advice to give me in this regard (you know a good machine to run Linux on, a good site to get recent, compiled versions and docs from, decent IDE's for Linux, etc.) click the "contact" link at the top, wouldja?

More on the technical aspects of The Monopoly later...
