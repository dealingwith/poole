> An african-american poet w/ industrial band dressed in american-indian
affectations with a bowie-jagger stage presence...either the peak of
postmodern cool or complete crap. I've deconstructed the spectacle too much to
know.

Last night we went to Saul Williams ([1][1], opener:[2][2] [3][3] [4][4],
[5][5]/[6][6] {quoted above}, [7][7] [8][8] [9][9]), which made me want to
quit art and give up on humanity. The former isn't a bad thing; I have a long
post or series-of-posts explaining exactly what I mean coming in the next 1-12
months...
