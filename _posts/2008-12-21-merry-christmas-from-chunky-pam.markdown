I first saw this a year ago, and if you are one of the kids still watching MTV
you probably saw it what? 2-4 years ago? But, I am [more in the Christmas
spirit this year][1] so I'm posting anything remotely Christmas-related that
isn't cheesy. Which still isn't much.

Also, LJ has changed, yet again, the way they do object embedding, so videos
are, yet again, not showing up in the RSS feed, and hence, danielsjourney.com.

I had SWIM so close to a release, a little over a year ago. It would be so
nice to have back at this point.
