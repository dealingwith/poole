[FLOYD RETOOK YELLOW TODAY][1]. As unlikely as it was for an American named
Lance Armstrong to win the Tour de France in 1999, then win it 6 additional
times in succession, it is even more unlikely that another American would win
the next tour following, particularly in the fashion that he did. I fucking
love this sport.
