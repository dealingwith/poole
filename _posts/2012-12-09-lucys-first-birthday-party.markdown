Lucy turned 1 on Friday and yesterday we had some friends over for a celebration of her first year. Carissa transformed our backyard into a fabulous space that held so much joy, love, friendship, and fun for all ages. I'm really proud of her for the amazing way she hosts.

> She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.  
She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.  
She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.  
Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:  
"Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all."
