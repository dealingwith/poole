I know this might get old for the rest of you <em>not</em> married to her, but I just have to tell you about this one thing: Miriam right now is reading like her 4th <a href="http://kiosk.mdlf.org/estore/product?id=231">book</a> written entirely in Bosnian. This latest one is written by a Bosnian, but it is presented as the translation of letters written between an American aid worker in Bosnia and his gay lover back home, complete with translation notes. Take that David-Foster Wallace.



Here is a bit from when the American found a note written in English on his windshield:<blockquote>...dont park andr maj balkoni. If aj dont let to san of maj nejbrs tu parking hije, vaj aj &scaron;ud let ju?



I nou det ju mejk fri maj kantri, and aj nou det ju a kipers of auer bradrhud end junihud, but this is maj andrbalkoni teritori. Aj &scaron;el fajting for that teritori...



Bat, if ju ask mi for premi&scaron;n, aj vil eloud ju tu parking andr maj balkoni. Bikouz, aj em -- merhametli. Ther is nou ingli&scaron; vord for merhametli, ajem &scaron;ur. It is min det aj hev a gud soul.</blockquote>Just keep reading it outloud until you start getting it. It's totally funny.
