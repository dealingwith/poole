http://www.steve.museum/

ok, first off, when did "museum" become a [TLD][1]?

second off...check out the Flash tag cloud. i literally "ooo"'d. except: are
they really spacially sorted intelligently, i.e. are more related tags closer
together. and: when you click on a tag it goes zooming by! ack! nothing else?
no "stop here and examine further from this point"?

at any rate, this is one of the closest things i've seen to the original
concept of SWIM.
