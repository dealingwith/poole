> [Scene] Two of the many overweight women who work here. Break room. Waiting
for coffee machine to produce swill that passes for coffee.

[Woman #1] "I don't understand it, I'm doing Atkins but I'm still fat!" [Woman
#2] "Oh I know, I have the same problem. I mean, I eat low carb mostly, but I
still gain weight! I can't figure it out!" [Woman #1 picks up her Blueberry
Sara Lee Muffin and opens it. Please note, these muffins are 2 servings per
package, which means you'd need to cut the muffin in half, AND each serving
has roughly 425 calories, 22g of fat, and close to 50g of carbs *mostly sugar
carbs* and begins eating. Assuming she eats the whole muffin, we're looking at
850 calories, 44g of fat, and 100g of carbs. I see this woman several times
per day, she eats at least TWO full muffins per day.] [Woman #2 cracks open a
20oz bottle of Mt. Dew and pack of mini-donuts] [Tviokh] *HEAD EXPLODES*

[End Scene]

....God, if you're going to claim to do Atkins, at least do it when you're NOT
cramming a muffin and soda into your gaping maw.
