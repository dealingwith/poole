Better stories about Toronto than this one forthcoming. Toronto was really
quite amazing. The flight home: not.

  * approx 6-6:30pm EST Sunday: board plane for Dallas

  * approx 7-7:30pm EST: informed of malfunctioning door on plane. change
planes

  * approx 8-8:30pm EST: informed of malfunctioning computer on new plane.
plane "powered down" and then, apparently, "back up" (judge for yourself if
these are proper uses of quotation marks). plane apparently runs Microsoft.

  * approx 8:30pm EST-11pm CMT: fly from Toronto airport to the general
vicinity of the Dallas-Ft. Worth airport. fall into holding pattern somewhere
above Waco.

  * 12am CMT Monday: run low on fuel. land in Houston. yes, Houston.

  * 12-3am CMT: wait in line in Houston terminal for hotel voucher, flight
coupon, and new flight bookings for Monday morning. there were only approx 60
ppl on the flight. we were about 3/4ths back in the line. you do the math.

  * 3:30-6:45am CMT: sleep. arrangements dramatically different than those
enjoyed in Toronto. additionally, people are **noticeably** more mentally
challenged (see also previous bullet).

  * 7:30am CMT: check in for flight to Dallas.

  * 10ish: arrive, Dallas.
