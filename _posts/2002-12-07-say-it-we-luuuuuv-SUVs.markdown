<i>the amusing thing about this for me is that i saw the marketing data (yes, a lot of it really does read a bit like that) back in '95 on suvs from a couple of car companies i did web work for. at that time it was all about giving the minivan market something that let them deny that they were part of that demographic. i still look at suvs to this day and think "you're not fooling anyone, you're just driving a funny shaped MINIVAN of DENIAL!" i think if i started a bumpersticker campaign for suvs, it would probably be stickers that read "pity me, i paid too much for my minivan."</i>
