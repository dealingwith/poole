[When I registered six domain names at the end of a 14-hour writing day
earlier this month][1], I didn't realize that my actions would reach all the
way up to the Vatican. I figured that some idiot was going to do it, so the
idiot might as well be me.

I've received an offer from a gambling site. I'm pretty sure that's a bad
idea, ecclesiastically speaking, but I should contact Bill Bennett to make
sure.

Thinking out loud, I'm trying to figure out what I might ask for, should Pope
Benedict's people get with my people (a hastily convened College of Cardinals
that includes my grandmother Rita and my in-laws, fellow Catholics whose
commitment to our faith was demonstrated by their nine children).

Here are some things I would like. Please do not call them demands:

* I. Three days, two nights at the Vatican hotel they built for the conclave.
* II. One of those hats. * III. Complete absolution, no questions asked, for
the third week of March 1987. * IV. A back-cover blurb from the Pope for the
next edition of Movable Type 3 Bible Desktop Edition. But only if he uses the
book to create his own weblog. * V. World peace.
