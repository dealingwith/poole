[Obama's Win: A Death-Knell For 1960s Cultural Politics?][1]

> Obama's victory represents a potential death knell -- but only a potential
one -- for the 1960s cultural politics that defined and dominated our
political landscape for the last four decades of the 20th Century.

There's a tidy symmetry in the fact that Obama defeated, in succession, both
the Clinton machine and the Rove-Atwater brand of politics that Republicans
have honed for so long.

In so doing, Obama defeated not one, but both of the leading practitioners of
that 1960s-rooted cultural politics. More to the point, he did this by quite
literally running against politics as both those groups practiced it.

Some commentators argued that McCain wasn't a GOP candidate in the Rove-
Atwater mode. In reality, however, McCain and Sarah Palin were perfect
vehicles for Rove-Atwater politics. As Josh argued yesterday, Palin is the
most aggressive purveyor of the culture-war politics of resentment that Rick
Perlstein superbly described in "Nixonland" since, well, Nixon.

Or [as GYWO put it][2]:

process baby boomers' psychological issues?
