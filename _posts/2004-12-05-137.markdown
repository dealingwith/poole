The Playlist Meme

1. Open up the music player on your computer.

2. Set it to play your entire music collection.

3. Hit the "shuffle" command.

4. Tell us the title of the next ten songs that show up (with their
musicians), no matter how embarrassing. That's right, no skipping that
Carpenters tune that will totally destroy your hip credibility. It's time for
total musical honesty. You can put the list in the comment thread, or write it
up in your blog or journal and then post a link in the comments.

5. If you get the same artist twice, you may skip the second (or third, or
etc.) occurances. You don't have to, but since randomness could mean you end
up with a list of ten song with five artists, you can if you'd like.

Here's my list:

> Kennedy Hopkins Mix - Presidents of the United States of America - Little
Blue Dune Buggy

Tom Conlon - Am I In Trouble

Thievery Corporation - Dance On Vaseline

Matt Pond PA - Emblems - Summer (Butcher Two)

Portishead - It Could Be Sweet

XiuXiu - I Love The Valley OH!

Marc Broussard - The Wanderer

Starsailor - Shark Food

Rage Against The Machine - Fuck Tha Police (Live)

Gotan Project - Triptico
