[RNC shells out $150K for Palin fashion][1]

> The Republican National Committee has spent more than $150,000 to clothe and
accessorize vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and her family since her
surprise pick by John McCain in late August.

Next time someone asks you to be their VP running mate, just remember how it
might benefit your wardrobe.
