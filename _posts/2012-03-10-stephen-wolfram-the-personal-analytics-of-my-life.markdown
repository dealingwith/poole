> ...in time I'm looking forward to being able to ask Wolfram|Alpha all sorts of things about my life and times--and have it immediately generate reports about them. Not only being able to act as an adjunct to my personal memory, but also to be able to do automatic computational history--explaining how and why things happened--and then making projections and predictions.
