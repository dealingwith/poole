"Great." and "Great!" have two vastly different meanings in modern America.
This is only a problem in written form due to their spoken forms (the original
vs. sarcastic use) and because of the implied voice of the full stop vs. the
exclamation point.

I observed this apparency* while writing an email in a casual-yet-not-informal
context. "Awesome." has the read connotation I was looking for, but the word
was too informal for the situation. "Great." was what came next; it was only
upon re-reading the email that I realized the problem. Instead of finding
another appropriate word I decided to save time and go with the potentially
overly affective* exclamation point.

* ah, see, I still manage two words of the day
