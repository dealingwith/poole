[the dialog][1]

> Bottom line--I'm afraid. I'm afraid of what other people would think, have
thought, are thinking. I'm afraid of your thoughts, your opinions. I seek your
praise and your love and your adoration and your admiration but I fear even
more your hate and your condescension and your laughter ...and I fear
absolutely the most, to the point of a frozen death stuck here in my tracks,
not that going into the studio for the sake of going into the studio and for
no other return than that would break the Miller family bank, but that the
world would say, "What a waste," and "Look at that poor boy," and "What was he
thinking." I fear that once again nobody will care about the thing that is
produced, that the Immediacy, yes, even that, will vanish, completely washed
over by the imminent unrecognizability, the lostness of it all, the only
people being the few that I give it to and the few that actually buy it--my
most proudest project of all. Stacked up in the not-so-metaphorical garage of
failure once again.

[recording][2]

"Innocence has been lost."

"The apple has been eaten."

"God is going to be PISSED!"
