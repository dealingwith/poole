[People are getting surgery to look like their Snapchat selfies](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/9ca4f7c6-d2c3-4e25-862c-03aed9ec1082)

>Cosmetic enhancements are increasingly seen as normal, with celebrities and reality TV stars openly having procedures. That, combined with the fact that social media seems to negatively impact self-esteem--a 2015 report from the Office for National Statistics found that 27% of teens who engage with social media for more than three hours a day have symptoms of mental health issues--may explain the emergence of ‘Snapchat dysmorphia’.

>Kacie, 29, is one woman opting for cosmetic procedures to look more like her filtered selfies. Her biggest concern was how her boyfriend would feel seeing her in person after receiving her selfies all day (she sends about 50 Snaps a day in total, and updates her Instagram stories around 10 to 15 times a day).

>“I would do flower crowns or the doggy nose, and I would look so cute in the photos. Then I would look at myself in the mirror, and think, ‘Ugh, this isn’t the person he is seeing on his screen all day,'" says Kacie. “I would get frustrated when I looked in the mirror, feeling like I didn’t look like the person I was putting into the world.

>“With Snapchat filters, I felt I was beautiful. I just needed a push to get there.”
