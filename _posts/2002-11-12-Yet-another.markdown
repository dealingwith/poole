<P>...<A href="http://www.macromedia.com/desdev/contribute/">content mngmnt system</A>? you can <A href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/contribute/productinfo/features/">take the tour</A>.........wow; waaaaaay <EM>not</EM> SIMPLE! No price yet, but you can be pretty sure it's more than <A href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">DW</A>, which is 400 clams! (No secret I'm not a big MacroMedia fan...) Come to think of it, this system is really damn flawed, from what I can tell...the content producers see the actual page layout? Why? Why don't they just have a form for each type of content they produce? Hmmm...I'm always asking rhetorical questions about the way I'm going to do <A href="http://swm.danielsjourney.com">SWM</A> aren't I?</P>
<P>...<A href="http://paolo.evectors.it/ideaTools/">and another</A>. This one runs on <A href="http://www.userland.com/">Frontier, which is way more than Manila</A>, which seems like a great CMS. Lesson, don't build yer CMS on someone else's big-ass product. Another interesting thing about this one--they use Radio to weblog. </P>
