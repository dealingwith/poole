<img src="http://danielsjourney.com/blog/files/2005/06/house.gif" align="right" alt="queen street commons" />I am in the process of thoroughly entrenching myself in Dallas, so this is just a random thought, but upon reading more about <a href="http://www.queenstreetcommons.org/">the Queen Street Commons</a>, I want to move to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Prince+Edward+Island,+Canada&ll=46.505954,-63.185120&sll=37.062500,-95.677068&spn=1.362993,2.460938&sspn=49.777905,78.750000&hl=en">PEI</a>. From <a href="http://smartpei.typepad.com/robert_patersons_weblog/2005/06/queen_street_co_1.html" title="not a direct link to the PDF">a PDF about QSC</a>:

<blockquote>The social norms of the Commons go back, beyond <a href="http://www.economist.com/World/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2281736" title="i added this link for your contextual pleasure">Lloyds</a>, to traditional times when tribal life was the norm for humans.
Where work, life, play and family were all one. The Commons takes us back to a time when we took responsibility
for both ourselves and for the greater good of the whole. The Commons is a space where relationships are not
positional but real. The Commons takes us back "home"; to where people feel most comfortable and productive.</blockquote>

from <a href="http://smartpei.typepad.com/robert_patersons_weblog/2005/06/queen_street_co.html">Robert Paterson's post about motivations</a>:

<blockquote>I miss belonging to a community. I miss the accidental discovery that comes from simply interacting. I miss how easy it can be to look up and se a friend across the table. I miss the jokes, banter and flirting. I miss the adventure of doing something difficult and dangerous with a cool group of people. I miss the adventure of university where we would stay late and talk about mystery. I miss playing games and being silly with friends, I miss hanging out. I miss being with special people.




I want to go back to the best of work and to the best of university.




We are doing our best to set up a place where we can find this sweet spot of life again.</blockquote>

I'm extremely upbeat and optimistic today, and I'm wondering why. But it was great to learn more about a project I was already greatly interested in, and seeing that it is being actualized; I send good vibes your way, QSC, PEI, and <a href="http://silverorange.com/">silverorange</a>!
