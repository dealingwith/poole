6 years ago, on 10-10-10, I married the most amazing woman in the world. In the last year she has proven just how amazing she really is.

She is loving, kind, patient. She sees the good in everyone and everything. She is optimistic, generous, caring. Sensitive, she feels deeply. Where others take pain and create anger and resentment, she creates meaning.

She's beautiful, inside and out. But let's talk about the latter for just a second.

One must start with the lips. While all of the physical characteristics are perfection, the lips stand as the focal point of it all, the collection point in the center of a solar grid, the altar around which all idols are organized. 

The way the neck and the shoulder form is some kind of object lesson on the potential of nature. When the hair is short all of this is on display, and often times too much for the one observing! When the hair is longer, it falls itself along this flawless path, somehow both obscuring and highlighting this mysterious grace.

Follow, then, the arm. A sign of strength, the arms are not showy, but their message is clear: stability, courage, vitality, potency. The arms, of course, fall into the wrists and the hands. The hands are almost a match for the lips; their compliment, they wear the mountains and valleys that are magnificent and beautiful and the evidence of years of earth's movements. The hands remain aloof, belying their skill. 

One will then naturally observe the figure, which is the envy of all, no doubt. 

Finally, allow the eye to rise again, all the way up to the eyes. These giant pools of glory and grace hold the entire world in their depths.

Within those depths, the soul: a cave of fascinations, the wardrobe to another world, the looking glass into wonder. It is free of assumptions and judgment. It is full of acceptance and hospitality. Beyond that kindness is a strength. Strength watches kindness, sword in hand, and will rush forward to the soul's threshold when required, without hesitation. Yet behind the strength lies gentleness and trust. 

And so then it is no surprise that this being exhibits very high levels of attraction; praise bubbles from the confused mouths of those around her; they--and I--stand it awe.

Next month we will celebrate 9 years of being together. I can honestly say that, while I might have lost the plot on a number of occasions during those 9 years and I won't pretend the life of our family of 5 is all roses, the story of my love for her is stronger than ever. I really am in awe of her. I find myself simply staring at her, until she uncomfortably asks me, "What?" Every day I get to experience brand new love. I can't wait to see what the next 9 years has in store.
