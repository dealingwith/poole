...by telling you...

that after watching "What the Bleep..." I've decided to live intentionally,
think positively, and create my own reality. No I'm not being weird about it,
but it's already been better since....

the other thing that precipitated this is i had a really good Sunday...until
Sunday night, when I found out someone was talking complete shit behind my
back. kinda ruined the rest of my night.

but Monday morn I woke up and realized that people are always talking shit
about me behind my back...what difference does it make who and that I actually
saw what the shit was? who cares? it's like getting pissed off about
thunderstorms. these are just people thunderstorms.

that analogy sucks really bad.

but anyhoo.

point is i can only control my reaction to ppl talking shit about me, so i
choose to do that.
