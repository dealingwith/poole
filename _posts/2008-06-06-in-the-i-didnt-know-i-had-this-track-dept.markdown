An OS FAIL today has precipitated long-overdue file backing-up and cleaning
up. While consolidating some mp3's I found a mystery file, no ID tags, named
simply "firefly".

I listened to the track and still had no idea, so I googled some lyrics, and
it turned out to be Don Peris.

Now, you don't have to look any further than my last.fm profile to know that
I'm a pretty big Innocence Mission fan.

So I was pretty stoked to find this track in the bin, as it were.

It is off his [Ten Silver Trombones][1] record.

[Don Peris - Firefly][2]
