<a href="http://faithmaps.blogspot.com/2002_06_01_faithmaps_archive.html#78351065">emergesque</a> (2) :: was catching up a bit on Stephen's blog (didn't know he had one until today) and found this excellent review of Der Krieger und die Kaiserin (the Princess and the Warrior). Through his excellent links I found out that I had been poorly informed that Franka Potente (middle, below) had written and directed Run Lola Run and The Princess. Tom Tykwer (right, below) is the director. This serves as correction for all those I might have told the wrong thing. And go see The Princess. It's good. Read Stephen's review.
