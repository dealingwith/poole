so here are two random thoughts:



1. me warning you that i'm going to get busy and might not update this blog is very much like our little homeland security warnings, so far just a buch of BS! despite that, i must say, i really am busy and am going to just stop. really. i mean it this time. go right now and buy some duct tape.



2. who the hell, what economist, thought up the word "foodstuffs"??
