<a href="http://www.next-wave.org/aug02/my_new_church_pt2.htm">next-wave.org - the church and culture</a> My New Church Part 2 is online at Next-wave. It has a little trouble with font size, bold or italics, table borders, and links, but that's ok. You know what I'm trying to say...and I love the bio Hopkins made for me!

PS The subtitle of this piece is "My Old Church" ...and I am definately NOT amazing...
