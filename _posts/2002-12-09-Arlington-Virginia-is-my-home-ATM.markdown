a sign near our place that i have been meaning to take a picture of for a while now.

"U Like Good Taste Gourment" is what the sign says. almost across from the empty bob peck lot.


last night we went to see three of my friends play at staccato, a cool little club in DC. first up were the Hsu sisters. meant to take shots during their set. oops. anyway, amazing music.

jake stephens was second. a view from the loft. i like all the little things in this shot.

courtney was last, we had to leave before it was over to catch the train and get to bed.
