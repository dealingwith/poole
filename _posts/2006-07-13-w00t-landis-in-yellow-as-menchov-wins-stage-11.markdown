jersey

Floyd Landis (Phonak) donned the yellow jersey on Thursday after finishing
third behind Denis Menchov (Rabobank) and Levi Leipheimer (Gerolsteiner) in
the mountainous 11th stage.

"I had to be careful because I didn't have a lot of teammates with me in the
final climbs, but I felt good today," said Landis.

Menchov, named the victor in last year's Vuelta a Espa√±a after winner Roberto
Heras was disqualified for doping, outkicked the disappointed Leipheimer for
the stage win as Landis contented himself with taking time on his rivals for
the overall.

The Russian is now a new race favorite, but after sharing out the victory
spoils he admitted it is early days yet.

"On the final climb I just happened to find myself with two teammates, and
they did a lot of work which was a huge help to me in the end," said the
Russian, who moved up to third place overall behind Cyril Dessel after the
Frenchman lost the yellow jersey to Landis by only eight seconds. "It wasn't
easy. Stages like that are always hard. But after 200km I still felt
relatively okay."

With three tough days starting in the Alps as of Tuesday, Menchov said it
would be premature to begin naming an eventual successor to the now retired
Lance Armstrong.
