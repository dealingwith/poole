Portraits of Frida Kahlo by Nickolas Muray</a>

December 10, 2004 - January 22, 2005



Went gallery hopping last night. First was Photographs Do Not Bend Gallery for these amazing photographs of Frida. They hang through January, so if you are interested in going let me know; I want to go back and spend more time with the work.



Next was a house show by <a href="http://jimfrederickstudios.com/">Jim Frederick</a> and <a href="http://whimdesigns.com/">Willian Miller</a>.



Lastly the <a href="http://www.whatartindallas.com/xoAustin/FrameSet.htm">Austin Turley</a> show at Continental.
