I think my count was 9 drinks last night. So yeah, I'm hungover again today.
Same sleep schedule as the previous night as well, 3-10:30, not even looking
at the 10:00 panel lineup because...well, I'm realizing the futility of 10
a.m. panels.

Last night was the pleasant surprise of a [Happy Bullets][1] show a little
outside of the sxsw milieu, and it was, as usual, an excellent show.

So I went to the [Tagging 2.0][2] panel just now and damnit with a name like
that I should have known better. It sucked, and I made the additional stupid
decision to sit way up front (because it was packed with people sitting on the
aisles), so when I left I had to walk quite a ways.
