<a href="http://www.acutecut.com/arkiv/001209.php">this list of questions from Rasmus</a> seems like a really good place to start in looking back over the last year:<blockquote>I ask myself questions like: Which people are new in my life this year? How have they affected me? How have I evolved as a person? As an artist? How did other events in my immediate surroundings affect me? Events in the rest of the world?</blockquote>

So...which people are new in my life this year? Wow. So many. So many.



How have they affected me? They've helped me survive. They've helped me live. Notice it is affected not effected. They have affected me greatly. Thank you all.



How have I evolved as a person? Yoy.



As an artist? An interesting one. In a year when I experienced the ulitimate rejection and was told that it was in part <em>because</em> I am an artist...and had taken away what I thought was the opportunity to become that artist...but at the same time freed to become that artist...it is hard to say how I've evolved...I think that I've finally lived through the kind of things that make one a true artist; gone through the fire that forms an artistic life, one based on a passion for the truth and love many of us so desperately seek but so rarely find in the manner we expect..."ain't it crazy what's revealed when you're not looking all that close...ain't it crazy how we put to death the ones we need the most."



How did other events in my immediate surroundings affect me? Yoy. I had the reset button hit on my life; but I hope that I saw Trickster at that crossroads, if so <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0865475369/ref=sib_vae_srch/104-1597650-4722308?v=search-inside&keywords=crossroads&x=0&y=0">then maybe there is something to come from all of this</a>. A beautiful, meaningful story, even.



Events in the rest of the world? May I put my head in the sand now?
