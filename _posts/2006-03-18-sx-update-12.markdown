Last night was [The Heavenly States][1], where I ran into [Chad
Stockslager][2] (who's last show I'm missing right now I think, but how I
missed their shows with Kris Kristopherson and the Drive-By Truckers I do not
know...will have to be sure to catch them next time they play D) and [Over the
Rhine][3] at Antone's and of course you all know how much I worship Over the
Rhine but fortunately I brought a clean pair of underwear for afters.

Then on to a surprise [Rhett Miller][4] show where it was like a circle jerk
of Dallas all-stars including [Salim][5], [Robert Jenkins][6], and I finally
got to meet [Sarah Hepola][7] and outside the venue afters we discussed New
York, hipsterness, and [Paul Ford][8]'s brilliance.

Then sushi and some silly Texas band and [The Aeroplanes][9] at Spiros and a
late night hanging in [Bob Schneider][10]'s old house/practice space/whatever
I couldn't really understand the status there.

All rock music is beginning to blur together into one muddy hole of sameness.
Ack.
