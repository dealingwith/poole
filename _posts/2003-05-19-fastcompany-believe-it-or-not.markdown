<blockquote>Most companies have lost their zeal for tech-driven transformation. But fast companies keep the faith. They believe that the Internet remains the most powerful laboratory for business experimentation ever. It transforms how people work together, how companies interact with customers, and the economics of entire industries. There is nothing more disruptive today than an original strategic insight fueled by a savvy application of computers and communication.</blockquote>via <a href="http://www.jordoncooper.sk.ca/2003_05_01_archives.html#200305805">coop</a>. thanks for quoting large chunks!
