So, like, today, my cell phone rang and the caller ID said "caller ID
unavailable" so I like picked it up anyway and some dude on the other side
said "who's this" and I said "Daniel" and he said "Daniel, my dick's hard" and
hung up.

I guess the sound of my name just has that effect on some people!
