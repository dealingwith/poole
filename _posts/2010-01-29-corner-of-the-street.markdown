> Down by the corner of the street,  
Where the three roads meet,  
And the feet  
Of the people as they pass go "Tweet-tweet-tweet",  
Who comes tripping round the corner of the street?  
One pair of shoes which are Nurse's;  
One pair of slippers which are Percy's. . .  
Tweet! Tweet! Tweet!  

[Milne][1], from [When We Were Very Young][2] (1924), from tonight's story
time.
