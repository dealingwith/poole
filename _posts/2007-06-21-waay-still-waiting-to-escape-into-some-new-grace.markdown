> This is what happens when you leave the orbit of a large mass. You lose its
gravity, but escape into some new grace. For a while many of us have circled
the heavy institution of the church, considering an escape velocity, but
always dragged back toward its centre. And I wonder if it's going to be soon
time to jettison that aging planet, and find new orbits entirely. It may be a
long and strange journey, in some weird and wonderful craft. But it's one I
feel we'll have to make. Leave the sterilized, artificial atmospheres of the
'special case', and jump into the general relativity of the Universe in its
hugeness.
