I like Greg Laswell. His previous, sad record was there with me during a sad
time, and now his new, hopeful record is there with me now, during a hopeful
time, when I am indeed [finding where I fit][1]. Also, I just like his songs,
and Elijah Wood is in his video.

Sorry about the pre-roll ad, the video has been removed from Laswell's [own
youtube account][2] :/
