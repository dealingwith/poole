ok this is the last in this little series from relevant. more from the JA Rule interview, with some of my annotation at the end:

<b>BeliefNet: Now tell me about the title of the new album: "John 3:36." He who believes in JA rule shall have everlasting love?</b>
<i>JA Rule: Yeah. 

Obviously, that's on a play on John 3:16: "He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him." How do you fee that people are going to react to that? What do you think Christians are going to say to that? I don't care what Christians say. </i>

<b>OK, that's fine. So what do you want out of that title? What are you trying to say?</b>
<i>It's a message to the world: Believe in me, no fake love. I don't need people coming up and smiling at me and being my friend for now because things are going well. You don't got to be my friend now, you got to be my friend when I'm cold, you know, we don't have to have a friendship if its not genuine, understand what I'm saying, and that's basically what the statement is about.</i>

...and what JA Rule should've said to that last question:
<i>Didn't you hear what I just said? I don't give a </i>fuck <i>about what you </i>think!
