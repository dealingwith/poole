I think I'm just going to let the images speak for themselves. {This is the first of 3-4 posts...this is my first batch of color, I have another color roll and a black and white roll yet...those will have to wait for another day as my Real Life is out of control busy right now.}

{I wish this one had come out better; as it is I photoshopped it a lot. But the sun was not cooperating, as is the case most of the winter...if only he had been holding the sign on his other side...} This guy looked like he had been in many a civil rights march back in the day. He was just standing totally still, listening to the speakers, holding his sign. He seemed like one of the most experienced, purposeful people there that day.



One thing I hope to show through my pictures was the amount of diversity at the protest. It was really incredible.
