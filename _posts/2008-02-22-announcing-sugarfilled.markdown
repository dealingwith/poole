[![][1]][2]I have a new project, [sugarfilled][3], a brand umbrella and
consultancy that is essentially the combined forces of [Carissa Byers][4] and
myself. Between the two of us, we have all the creative and technical skills
any small business or team might need to create their image, online and off.
Brand ideation, logo design, photography, copywriting, web design, and web
development. Lots more can be found out at [the site][3], which I must add is
still a work in progress...there are lots of goodies yet to come.


This blog will become more active and a place for me to jot down thoughts
regarding the social and psychological aspects of the web and branding in an
always-connected, always-consuming world. The name and description have been
updated accordingly. (As for how long it will stay on blogger I can't say. I
do have my own CMS dog food to eat. This blog has just happened to live on
Blogger since forever.)


To those who might be reading this post on Sugarfilled, hello! This is one of
the blogs that [the sugar feed][5] is drawing from.
