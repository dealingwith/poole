The integration research site has been recently updated, in case ya hadn't noticed. It will be updated exponetially more over the coming months. I'll be sure to be talking it up here. Link in the menu there.



Also I have an email signup thingie over there too. Special goodies will be shared only with peps on that list. Thanks to those who have signed up and I'll be sending out the first goodness in a couple weeks.
