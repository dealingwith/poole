Bosnia and Herzegovina. this is my first show primarily

of the work can be sent to <a
href="mailto:dealingwith@yahoo.com">dealingwith@yahoo.com</a>.



music: <s>show at Club Clou (on Titova near eternal flame)
Sarajevo, Saturday, September 6.</s> possible US tour this fall.



blog: sorry, but danielsjourney is going on an extended
sabbatical for personal reasons. i can only assume that at some
point i will be back to this space, again being a dreamer,
someone who believes in love.



my dreams can only be in your hands. if you are interested in my
music in any way, my email is still the same, <i>daniel at
integrationresearch.org</i>, please contact me (and forgive me
if i am slow to respond). also if you are interested at all in <a
href="http://integrationresearch.org">integration research</a>,
an art and technology incubator and advocacy organization, please
do contact me as well.



 otherwise, i'll see you on the other side of whatever this
is.
