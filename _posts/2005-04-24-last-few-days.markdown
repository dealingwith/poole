[![/][1]][2]

smoked more than since being sick a couple weeks back. a bunch with drinks two
nights ago, a couple yesterday, now a couple today. i'm still totally
optimistic about quiting for good though. something's just not the same no
more. although this recent return to the smokes most noticable effect has been
an increase in inside-of-mouth chewing. this used to happen when i smoked
every once and a whileâ€¦i'd chew my mouth all up for a few days after.
