It was a musical Christmas.

We also got a Switch. We've been playing a lot of Maria Kart. It's very nostalgic for Penn (15) and I; we used to play it a ton on our old Wii. Milo (4) and I are trying to figure out Minecraft. I am old, so figuring out all the commands on the controller is a learning curve. Milo will quickly be more proficient than I at this version of Minecraft. 

It's been a very relaxing holiday for our family. I very much needed the time to reconnect with family and just have a mental break from the normal, hectic work life.

I've struggled with acceptance this year but I feel like I'm having some small breakthroughs here at the end of the year. It's a good time to reflect, as always. I still frequently feel restless, like I need to be _doing_ something...something _more_...but I'm finally learning that it is often best to do nothing, at least at first...to just be still and listen. I'm not the one in control, and that's ok.
