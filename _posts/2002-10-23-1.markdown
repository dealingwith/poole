<i>Elsewhere:</i> <b>More Good Doonesbury</b>

the blog series has been continuing. <a href="http://www.doonesbury.com/strip/dailydose/index.cfm">today's is particularly good</a>.

<a href="http://www.earthonempty.com/">some particularly (to me) funny strips from the recent past</a>.

you know, it's funny: i used to hate doonesbury, back in the day (those who know me know what i'm talking about). now i really like most of it. comics as barameters of social opinions?
