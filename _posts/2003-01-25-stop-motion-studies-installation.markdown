Very cool Flash installation using stop motion. Not what I expected from the intro but I liked it. ...could definately qualify for a JonnyBaker "worship trick."



<a href="http://turbulence.org/">turbulence.org</a> is a very cool org I might have mentioned on this site, maybe a year ago, when I first started thinking about nonprofit art orgs. They have been doing a lot of v good stuff; wish I had stopped by their site more often in the last 12 mos.
