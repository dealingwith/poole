Still testing me ol software.



<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2002-11-14-edit_x.htm">Fractured Bosnia offers USA cautionary tale on Iraq</a>

USA Today

A balanced view connecting Bosnia and potential future conflict considerations. Interesting that in Bosnia we were helping the defenders and in Iraq we will be the aggressors. Important distinction methinks. I definately believe intervention in Bosnia was <b>required</b> and even then <b>not adequate</b>, by the way.



Elsewhere, <a href="http://www.theyblinked.com/blog/">theyblinked</a> has a new locale and <a href="http://www.theyblinked.com/blog/2002_12_01_theyblinked_archive.html#85400311">waxes all utopic</a> on community (that link wasn't working last time I checked, but then it was still near the top...wow blogger stinks doesn't it?). I recommend mortals just scan the first couple paragraphs, but somewhere around <i>Paradosis</i> it gets interesting. Very much reminds me of some of Riddell's (one of my fav authors) writing. Only thing is I think it is, for most people anyway, fiction. If you have that kind of community consider yourself totally blessed.



Finally, I have already received two cool emails in response to my "Un-Christian Nation" post of earlier today. Thanks! Just a start, depending on how I feel about it, maybe the finish too.
