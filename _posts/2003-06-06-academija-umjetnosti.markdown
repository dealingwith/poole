I've been trying to get a decent digi shot of this place since we got here, and no, I wouldn't consider this a decent shot, but oh well. I haven't yet, believe it or not, made a walking trip around town for the sole purpose of taking pictures; and while the art college is literally right down the street from us, I hadn't yet walked on the far side of the (busy) street in order to get a clearer shot of the place. Anyway, this is somewhat of an iconic structure of Sarajevo.
