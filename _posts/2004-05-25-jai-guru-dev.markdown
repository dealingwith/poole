See? I said I would listen to them. [They][1] are awesome.

I am actually blogging this here in deference to my regular blog. Converting?
Loving it? Camping out? ...Maybe...

> ...do not worry about your life...do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow
will worry about itself...Provide purses for yourself that will not wear out,
a treasure...that will not be exhausted...

--Jesus (matt 6, luke 12)

> Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world.

--John Lennon

What can I say? [I know how you feel][2]. "I don't even {know} what month,
what season, what year." {Sory, now I'm quoting myself from an ancient song I
never sing.} ...I don't know when the ability to feel comes back.

All I know is a cool girl is cooking chocolate chip cookies right behind me
over there.
