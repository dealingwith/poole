_because one day soon, the world comes down and says goodbye._

A very odd day. I don't really know how to describe it but to say God showed
up. And I hope he doesn't leave.

lots, lots of the new polyphonic spree record, track 5 till the end. and the
innocence mission

> [Every burden shall be lifted. Every stone upon your back slide into the
sea.][1]

_somehow we will keep it alive if we try._
