I was just online for an hour and a half and I got through about 1/4 of my "to read" queue; and much of that I did not read, just decided not to.



Too much information. Too many people trying too many things too close to what I want but not quite.



SO I updated the <a href="./swim">swim area completely</a>. Still not sharing too much.
