[Gothamist: NYPD Investigates Cop Videotaped Throwing Cyclist Off Bike][1]:

> The cyclist who was [videotaped being body slammed off his bike in an
apparently unprovoked attack by an NYPD officer during Friday night’s Critical
Mass ride][2] has been identified as Christopher Long, a 29-year-old resident
of Bloomfield, New Jersey who works at the Union Square Greenmarket. His boss
tells the Daily News that Long is an Army veteran and "mild-mannered
environmental activist." Craig Radhuber, 54, was riding behind Long Friday
night and describes incident: “All of a sudden the cop picked this kid out and
bodychecked him. I couldn't believe what was going on. [The officer] body-
slammed this kid off the bicycle so hard that he went from the lane to the
curb.”

...in discussing the video with the News, an unidentified NYPD source says,
"The video is bad - what can you say?"
