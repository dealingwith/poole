[![][1]][2][Starsailor - On the Outside - This Time][3]

[get _On the Outside_][2]

In that moment I was frozen out Of a story that I knew all about Then I called
her in the evening My depression started lifting

I won't let it kill me This time I won't let it kill me This time

Up to the surface came a feeling Left me useless Left me reeling

I won't let it kill me This time I won't let it kill me This time When the
beats run dry there's gonna be some blood

I won't let it kill me This time I won't let it kill me This time
