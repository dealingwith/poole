1. It takes a lot of time to ride that much every day. Not just the 2-3 hours on the bike, but the time cleaning bikes, working on bikes, prepping for rides, recovering from rides, doing laundry...if it wasn't for the timing of the Festive, I would not be able to do it.
1. I can still push my body pretty far from its fitness homeostasis, but it becoming more difficult by the year. Last time I did the Festive I was 37. I'm 44 now. 40 was about the time I could start to feel myself being...not young anymore.
1. _If I had the time_, this would be a very enjoyable way to spend my time. I really enjoy riding my bike.
1. My metabolism went crazy. I ate to compensate, therefore losing no weight. I'm still about 10 pounds over my ideal weight. It would be interesting to do something similar (maybe not quite so beyond my fitness level) while also restricting calories to see if I could finally shed those 10 pounds.
1. I would like to mix up my riding more in 2020. Given my schedule, I'm relatively constrained to routes I can construct departing from my home. I would like to figure out how to make some rides in other places. I almost went to a ride in Richardson the last day of the Festive, but in the end, couldn't bear the 30+ minute drive. Perhaps I could hit some of the local fondo-style rides this year.
1. I would like to set and achieve some different big goals on the bike this year. I would like to ride another unsupported century. I would like to go to Tucson and climb [Mount Lemmon](https://goo.gl/maps/EEEpxxQkezZwLdRy8) again. I wouldn't mind going on a European bike vacation if I can scare up the time and resources.
