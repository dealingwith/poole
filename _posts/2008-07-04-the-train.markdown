I've had some [scary][1], [gross][2] and [interesting][3] experiences in my
two weeks of commuting by train (and still consider it to be a significant
improvement to my quality of life), but fortunately nothing quite like this.
[No Commercial Potential: Fluttered][4]:

> On the train this morning there was an extremely stressed and haggard-
looking butterfly flitting it’s battered little self against the windows. And
then as it rested against the tiny ledge around the window getting abraded by
the air conditioning vent, a guy calmly peeled it from its perch, threw it on
the floor, and stomped it.

I was on my way to my second day at a putting-on-pants, getting-on-a-train,
sitting-in-an-office job and decided it wasn’t a good time to go looking for
metaphors.
