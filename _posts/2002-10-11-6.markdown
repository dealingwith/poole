<i>Imagining</i>: <b>Greenbelt02</b>

I was just emailing Over the Rhine's people to make sure I'll get to take pictures at their show next Thursday, or at least "hey this guy taking pictures isn't some shmo," and I was looking for this picture on the blog, and it wasn't up yet. So here we go. (<a href="http://www.danielsjourney.com/index.php?archive=2002_09_01_archive.xml&id_pass=82146728">You can also read my excuses for these images</a>. I was far away.)
