So, from [the video I mentioned in my last post, _The Century of the
Self_][1]:

> One leading Wall Street banker...of Lehman Brothers, was clear about what
was necessary. "We must shift America," he wrote, "from a needs to a desires
culture. People must be trained to desire, to want new things even before the
old have been entirely consumed. We must shape a new mentality in America.
Man's desires must overshadow his needs."

(At about 16:00 in the video.) This quote was from the 1940's.
