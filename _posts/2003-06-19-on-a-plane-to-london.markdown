Here I am on a plane to London. I don't even know where I'm going to sleep tonight, but off I go. I do have a couple options; it's not that bad; just some logistics to go.



I strangly felt like I was already missing Sarajevo as I left. I guess that place has really, already, become home. Despite mostly fumbling around the place. Home is home.



I've brought plenty of work with me; I am considering this a bit of a coder's holiday...deep in the middle of the initial stage of my software project, I can't think about much else. But here I am anyway. At least I will be around people who speak my language. Literally.
