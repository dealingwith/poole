> The first advertisement appeared in USA Today a week ago, right on schedule.


People from around the world had stayed up all night waiting for it, talking
in chat rooms and online forums. It had to be a clue, they thought. Everything
before it had been a clue.


"LOST. The Cube," read the ad, posted at the top of the paper's "Notices"
section. "Reward Offered. Not only an object of great significance to the city
but also a technological wonder."


The cryptic notice, along with several subsequent ads in The New York Sun, The
Times of London and Monday's Sydney Daily Telegraph, are the first tangible
signs of a mystery called "Perplex City" beginning to unfold online.


It is the latest well-funded entry in a young medium called "alternate-reality
gaming"--an obsession-inspiring genre that blends real-life treasure hunting,
interactive storytelling, video games and online community and may,
incidentally, be one of the most powerful guerrilla marketing mechanisms ever
invented.


These games are intensely complicated series of puzzles involving coded Web
sites, real-world clues like the newspaper advertisements, phone calls in the
middle of the night from game characters and more. That blend of real-world
activities and a dramatic storyline has proven irresistible to many...

> Both he and Stewart say they see the medium as a developing art form--even
if it's equivalent to moviemaking in 1903--rather than simply a convoluted
promotional vehicle.


"The Internet basically is about searching for things and gossiping, and we
invented a way to tell stories that's about searching for things and
gossiping," Stewart said. "It is a much nicer way to deliver art across the
platform."
