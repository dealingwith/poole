I was spending much of last night on the <a href="http://overtherhine.com/orchard/index.php">OtR forums</a>, and reading <a href="http://www.overtherhine.com/orchard/index.php?showtopic=2772">Linford's Northern Spy #5, Dispatch from the Grey Ghost</a>, dreaming while still awake, contemplating what kind of life and legacy I want to have and how that relates or could work with sustaining myself month to month.



Dirty fingers on the keyboard, posting short replies, clicking through notes and pictures that give context to lives which I admire...
