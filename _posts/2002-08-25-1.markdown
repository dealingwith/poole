third post from GB and again i'm still quite frustrated in attempting to describe this thing in words. i have been taking some unique shots at the event, mostly black and white actually, not to mention the pictures i hope to get from other folks here, plus i will certainly try to snag as many of the graphics used in the installations as possible. i also have some artifacts from said installations that i will try to scan when i get back. of course i will have to locate a scanner!

anyway, today was another great day of alt.worship, music, hanging out. i helped set up _grace's_ service, which was a lot of fun for me to participate in. i also just saw a really funny band that was something like trigger happy tv and christian porn machine combined. they played this brilliant song called _true love waits (but masturbation doesn't)_. i got aaron the t-shirt, but don't tell him if he doesn't find out himself...

i also got invited to speak for a short time tomorrow at a seminar about the web...so i'll be able to share all my vast knowledge *ahem* ...we'll see...but it's cool to be particpating as a producer in another thing...all the constant consuming was getting to me!

refreshed...daniel, your anglophile abroad
