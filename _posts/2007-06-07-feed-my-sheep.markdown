Just saw [this][1] at the Bath House. One of the most intelligent religious
commentaries I've seen in a while.

> “Cruciform” is an ongoing series of sculptures. The work seeks to reflect
the unspoken desires and intentions that are sometimes hidden behind the urge
towards transcendence, the impulse to believe.

Also from his site:

> No, I don’t like work. I had rather laze about and think of all the fine
things that can be done. I don’t like work--no man does--but I like what is in
the work--the chance to find yourself. Your own reality--for yourself, not for
others–-what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and
never can tell what it really means.

- Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness
