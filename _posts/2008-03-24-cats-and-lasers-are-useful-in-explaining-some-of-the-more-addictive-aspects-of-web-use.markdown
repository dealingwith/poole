[Why We're Powerless To Resist Grazing On Endless Web Data][1]:

> Readers responded 60-40 against allowing comments. Even more striking than
the fact that these readers were denying themselves a voice was the reason
some of them gave for declining the offer: Like cats chasing a laser, they
wouldn't be able to stop themselves.

"In truth we would rarely opt not to read them," said one reader. "Blog
comments have the power to hammerlock one's attention. ... We'd be impotent to
resist looking over the rantings and counter-rantings. ... Not only would
comments be an incredible drain on one's time (especially if we check your
blog several times a day from work), but it also exposes readers to the nasty
underbelly of blogging."
