<b>full name:</b> daniel wayne miller

		
<b>DOB:</b> 03-25-75 <b>too lazy for math?</b> 27 yrs old

		
married to: miriam lacho miller

		
<b>children:</b> none yet. not opposed to the idea.

		
<b>currently residing:</b> Arlington, Virginia <b>soon to be:</b> Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina

		
<b>occupation:</b> ok, now you've asked the tough one. do you mean, by what do i earn money? if so, then 
		<a href="/design">web designer</a>. but i would hardly call it a living. mostly i alternate between the following: musician, photographer, software developer, technologist, information theorist and architect, 
		installation artist, activist, writer (fiction and non), volunteer, and armchair sociologist. someday "they" will create 
		a job for me of utmost importance and unfathomable pay. in the meantime i do the housework (not all of it though).

		
<b>past life:</b> software consultant and trainer, physical trainer, church music director, drum/guitar instructor, bicycle racer, psychology student, parking lot security guard.

		
<b>hobbies:</b> no. since i don't have a "real" job, i got to put all those under "occupation." oh, except for...

		
<b>travel abroad:</b> germany, slovakia, czech republic, austria, netherlands, italy, slovenia, england, australia, israel.

		
<b>beer or liquor:</b> definately better off with beer. days when i'm feeling fat: water.

		
<b>other dinner guest issues:</b> both miriam and i are <i>pescatarians</i>, which means for meat we only eat fish (but boy do we) and we 
		don't eat dairy. but if you put it in front of me and it looks good, i'll eat it. hopefully you don't give me seconds or 
		i'll be sick later.

		
<b>why would i know you?</b> most people come across this site through links off of pseudo-christian blogs, even though 
		i no longer consider myself a "christian" and most people who do run away crying when they spend more than 5 minutes here. i work 
		a lot in technology but am not really ever linked to from the tech blogosphere. my tech writing is mostly translation work for non-techies (sortof
		like my former job in training). <b>mostly</b> i am an art advocate and cultural pointer. i try to find new things in art and point them out 
		with some intelligence. my goal is to have all cultural consumers getting their goods from independent or low-overhead distribution channels. education
		is a key piece in that process, and i hope my site, beyond being an obvious platform for my own art, helps to contribute to that education.

		
<b>what was that word you just used?</b> yeah, i've semi-coined some stuff. not coined so much as adopted into my writing with frequency: <i>cultural consumers, cultural producers,
		cultivating organic cultural distribution networks, flattening existing cultural distribution hierarchies</i>. these are all terms you'll find...

		
<b>what is all this talk about a nonprofit and a web content management system?</b> uh, yeah, that's what i was about to say; i'm in the process of planning and forming a 
		nonprofit art organization that will help fund, promote, and otherwise enable what you might consider "non-market-oriented" cultural producers (artists), as well as 
		educate cultural consumers (you), in order to take on <i>the man</i> (major media conglomerates, record labels, publishing houses). i'm not about toppling what's already there, just 
		about providing an alternative for both the producers and consumers of this thing we call art, and hopefully allowing the spread of some love and spiritual goodness around as a result.

		

		The mCMS (micro Content Management System) is a piece of software I'm slowly building with the aim to both help fund the nonprofit, enable artists to take advantage of the World Wide Web, 
		and also have a humble pseudo-business which develops technology, namely software, that helps make the world a better place.
		

		<p align="right">...thanks for visiting and i hope you find something worthwhile enough to come back sometime!

		
<b>why didn't you ever capitalize the letter "i" in this thing?</b> dunno, but it sure as hell wasn't humility. must be some kind 
		of lame attempt at cynical irony, whatever <i>that</i> is.
