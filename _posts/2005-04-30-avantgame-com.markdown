From her [bio][2]:

> I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Performance Studies with a designated emphasis in New Media Studies at the University of California at Berkeley.  I'm also a member of UC Berkeley's [Alpha Lab][5] in the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research][6] and a resident game designer for the Berkeley Institute of Design.

> Outside of academia, I am an active game designer (high-tech, low-tech, and no-tech), currently with [42 Entertainment][8] (named Most Enterprising New Business in the 2005 _Best of the Bay_).  I specialize in massively- collaborative game models and games that are played in everyday public spaces. Some of them have won awards (_I Love Bees_ won the 2005 Innovation Award from the International Game Developers Association and was honored by the New York Times' 2004 Year in Review; the _Go Game_ was named "Best Way to Rediscover Your City" in 2002.) Most of my creative projects are covered by strict Non-Disclosure Agreements or secret blood pacts, or both.

...and lots of pictures of herself. {aside: is there some inverse relationship
between academic tech/design involvement and actual well designed
personal/public websites?}
