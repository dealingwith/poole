From her [bio][2]:

> I'm a Ph.D. candidate in [ Performance Studies][3] with a designated
emphasis in [New Media Studies][4] at the University of California at
Berkeley.  I'm also a member of UC Berkeley's [Alpha Lab][5] in the
[Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research][6] and a
resident game designer for the [Berkeley Institute of Design][7].


Outside of academia, I am an active game designer (high-tech, low-tech, and
no-tech), currently with [42 Entertainment][8] (named Most Enterprising New
Business in the [2005 _Best of the Bay_][9]).  I specialize in massively-
collaborative game models and games that are played in everyday public spaces.
Some of them have won awards (_I Love Bees_ won the [2005 Innovation
Award][10] from the International Game Developers Association and was honored
by the New York Times' [2004 Year in Review][11]; the_ Go Game_ was named
"[Best Way to Rediscover Your City][12]" in 2002.) Most of my creative
projects are covered by strict Non-Disclosure Agreements or secret blood
pacts, or both. However, I give away some of my secrets [here][13].

...and lots of pictures of herself. {aside: is there some inverse relationship
between academic tech/design involvement and actual well designed
personal/public websites?}
