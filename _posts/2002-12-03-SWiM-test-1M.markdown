Is this going to work? Does this work? Is that possible? What will I say?



What will I say in a second paragraph? This is going to go right up on the site?



No one cares. No one cares that my little program works 10%.



If this is on the site then 0.2 is 50%. The first option (line breaks--hey, that's all Blogger does either, and its so dern easy) of 1.2.1 is done.
