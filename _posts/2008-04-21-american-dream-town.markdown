> Meet Ochelata, Oklahoma, the typical American town. Today's American Dream
has changed from white picket fences to clawing for survival. Ochelata shows
us what happens when manufacturing jobs give way to service jobs, when the
middle class is decimated, and when a dream becomes a nightmare.

I don't know much about [this video][1] except that is uses and has the same
name as the last song off my last record. My record is Creative-Commons
licensed, so you don't even have to get my permission to use it in
noncommercial projects...I've already given the permission. [Seeing it in a
video like this is a lot of fun...][1]
