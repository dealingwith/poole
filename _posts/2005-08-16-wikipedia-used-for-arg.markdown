[BBC punks Wikipedia in game marketing ploy? (boingboing.net)][1]

> Someone has [apparently abused][2] collaborative reference site Wikipedia in
a viral marketing campaign for a BBC [online alternate reality game][3], or
ARG. Boing Boing readers ask whether the BBC (or someone acting on their
behalf, like a promotional agency) is responsible.


Here's the original Wikipedia entry, which presented fictional details from
the game as real: [Link][4]. Here's the entry in its current state, after
having been "outed" as bogus and edited by Wikipedians into a factual article
about the game: [Link][5].

...much more at the entry.


I'm not sure how to feel about this. I don't think I mind. This is kind of the
point of ARG, and apparently the entry(ies) were not created by the game's
project team at BBC.
