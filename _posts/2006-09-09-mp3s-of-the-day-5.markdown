It's been a while for an mp3 of the day. Seems like everytime I have what
seems like a really good or meaningful playlist going on the Winamp, I don't
have time to upload anything and post, or I decide to wait until I'm already
logged into FTP, which doesn't happen; and by the next day the playlist
doesn't seem nearly as good or meaningful, so I'm glad I never posted stuff
from it like it was the end all of music for the _nn_th day of Whatever, 2006.

[![][1]][2]But lately I've been pretty down, and listening to a lot of the the
[Innocence Mission][3], particularly [Glow][2], which I think, it is safe to
say, is my favorite IM record of their substantial catalog.

![][4]I'm surprised some of my [friends][5] who are so into
slowcore/shoegazer/whatever aren't more into IM. Granted, I'm a little more so
than most, having [grown up a stone's throw][6] from where IM are from--and
still live--[Lancaster, PA][7], and the fact that there is this whole [Over
the Rhine][8]/Innocence Mission fanbase that's pretty much the same and mostly
rural-northeastern.

[The Innocence Mission - Happy, The End][9]

[The Innocence Mission - Everything's Different Now][10]

[The Innocence Mission - Spinning][11]

But seriously, [this record could be some of the best three bucks you'll ever
spend][2]. I would list the other songs on the record that are worth thorough
savoring, but that would be _all of them_. If you get hooked on the Innocence
Mission after that, I would suggest [Birds of My Neighborhood][12], then
[Befriended][13] (more mp3s from those two records [on their site][14]) or
[Small Planes][15].

yes. i'm feeling rather nostalgic lately. sometimes for the "[past life][16]",
sometimes for times before that. part of me wants to return to the simplicity
of rural northeastern life. except for me that is all intermixed with the
simplicity of childhood.
