[![][1]][2][Starsailor - On the Outside - In the Crossfire][3]

[get _On the Outside_][2]

I don't see myself when I look in the mirror I see who I should be I don't see
myself when I look in your eyes Thank God for that

I don't see myself when I look cross the river I see where I should be I don't
see myself when I look from the sky Thank God for that I hear them screaming
On the radio Its getting louder In the crossfire Trying to find some hope From
the ashes of their broken homes

I don't see myself when they fail to deliver I see what I should be I don't
see myself when I look at the flag Thank God for that

I hear them screaming On the radio It's getting louder In the crossfire Trying
to find some hope

Our day will come We'll find the sun We'll find the fire We'll sanctify The
love we gave Our one desire

I hear them screaming On the radio Its getting louder In the crossfire Trying
to find some hope I hear them screaming On the radio Its getting louder In the
crossfire Trying to find some hope From the ashes of their broken homes

I don't see myself when I look in the mirror
