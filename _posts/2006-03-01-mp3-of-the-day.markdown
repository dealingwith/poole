> I don't see myself when I look in the mirror  
> I see who I should be I don't see myself when I look in your eyes  
> Thank God for that

> I don't see myself when I look cross the river  
> I see where I should be  
> I don't see myself when I look from the sky  
> Thank God for that

> I hear them screaming  
> On the radio  
> Its getting louder  
> In the crossfire  
> Trying to find some hope  
> From the ashes of their broken homes

> I don't see myself when they fail to deliver  
> I see what I should be  
> I don't see myself when I look at the flag  
> Thank God for that
