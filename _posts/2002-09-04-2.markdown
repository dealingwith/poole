<i>GB02</i>

Got some pics from <a href="http://www.smallritual.org/">Steve</a>. I of course would never put <i>all</i> those pics here...goodness...I look like death warmed over in some of them. But here we go anyway with a few:

...the tiny tea tent is a roving community of festival tea providence...if that makes sense...cool ambient to hang out and have some tea (which yes I enjoyed frequently!)...

...u always ran into someone u knew at the tea tent, this night I had been hangin' with Wood from <a href="http://johnheronproject.com">JHP</a> for a while, we ended up at the tea tent, and then Steve showed up and everyone photodocumented the event...in a few years I'll get my film developed and you can see my take on this monumental miniscule event. Wood has next to no pictures of himself on the net, so I didn't want to take the liberty here (besides I would get caught--I know he reads DJDC), so I digitally altered the pic. Plus I thought he would think it would be cool to be known as a living abstract painting...

<i>vaux</i>

I hate to keep talking about Vaux's service, but I happened to have the most notes, and now the first pictures, from that service...

They had a few themes for their service, like "Vaux is a four letter word," but the main one was "Sine." From my notes from Kester's talk, earlier in the day the Sat of their service:

Sine wave as a metaphor for life and suffering
why does it keep cycling is the ?
always trying to seek its center
god is the center
<center>what keeps us in the cycle at all?</center>
