While we do all [enter these delicate transactions with our own stuff][1], the
nature of that stuff can differ to great degrees. And it seems [that nature is
the most violent][2] when identity formation is part of that stuff. And the
mechanisms of both love and hate are identical when identity is on the line,
i.e. most of the time for most of the population. And the mechanisms of
identity revolve around the symbolic order, the big Other.

> By uttering [hate] speech, the subject seeks out the Other that would
confirm his or her identity and grant his or her authority. And paradoxically,
it is the addressee of this speech who plays the role of the "mediator"
between the sender and the big Other: by recognizing him- or herself as the
addressee of the sender's words, he or she actually occupies the place in the
symbolic structure from which the speaker receives confirmation of his or her
identity and authority.

[Salecl][3], 121

In both love and hate, we position _l'objet petit a_ in the place of the Other. When the _a_ has become a critical element of our identity formation (which is the nature of its existence in the first place), it is no wonder how we flip from love to hate so easily and so violently. It is our own identity that is paramount, and the human signifier of that identity will be used however necessary to maintain that identity.

[Part of all of this as it relates to me][4] is what I've made the _objet petit a_. ([See also][5]. I'm sure the connections I'm pointing out are too vague, even with the title attribute in my anchor tags.) But learning that perhaps a cojourneywoman [whose identity formation has moved beyond this set of almost animal mechanizations][6] would be...a place to start.

There's more here. There's always more here. I'm late for many meetings.
