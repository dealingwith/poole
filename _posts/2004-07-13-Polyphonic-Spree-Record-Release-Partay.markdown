I had this short conversation with the drummer [paraphrased]:



"Listen to the record," he instructs me.



"Actually, I have been," I inform him.



"Oh," he surprises.



"A friend hooked me up with it a few weeks ago."



Look of irritation and subtle confusion: "Where'd he get it?"



"I don't know, from a friend who always has everything. The original source is unknown."



More irritation, possible pissy-ness [me realizing maybe I shouldn't have said anything], something like, "Yeah you never know with these things."



"But I came and got the actual artifact!" holding up signed CD leaf dramatically.



"That's a good thing!" somewhat condescendingly.



"But you're what? A 23-member band now? At 15 bucks, even <em>if</em> you got all the money from it, that's less than a buck a person. That's harsh!"



"Yeah..." trailing out and looking dejected.



"I felt like I should have just come here, gone down the line and given everybody a couple bucks."



Look of astonishment. Me realizing I shouldn't go into the whole rethinking-distribution tirade of <a href="http://integrationresearch.org">Integration Research</a>. Move on to next person.
