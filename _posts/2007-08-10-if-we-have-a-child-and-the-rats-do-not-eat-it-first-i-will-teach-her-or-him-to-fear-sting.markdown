[The Tour (Ftrain.com)][1]

> And Brooklyn, with its glut of desperate wombs, has no shortage of upmarket
strollers, the squeaks and caws of their passengers cautiously analyzed by
their wrinkled mothers for signs of autism (bad) or genius (good). I am soon
to get married, but given the general despair of the era and the fact that the
oceans are now 58% molten lead I do not think of the joys of tiny fingers
grasping my thumb but instead relentlessly catalog the disasters that could
befall us, assuming of course that my ability to father a child has not been
obliterated by all these years spent sucking down crooked molecules.
