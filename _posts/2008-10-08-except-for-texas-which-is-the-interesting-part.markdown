[From "if the culture war actually happened][1]"

> So my theory is that regardless of the outcome of this election the US
eventually drifts towards a multi-state solution wherein California secedes
(or re-asserts it's independence, depending on your perspective) and joins up
with the Pacific Rim economies. The New England states do basically the same
thing with the EU and the upper Midwest moves it's capital to Chicago and
builds out sort of a USA-lite type of nation around that. The rest of the
country goes to hell and joins the 3rd world, except for Texas, which is the
interesting part. Texas embraces the concept of “limited government” to the
extreme, suspending all environmental and societal controls. It basically
turns into hyper-China where lawlessness and disorder are rampant, but profits
are insanely high. The rest of the country abandons oil, but Texas decides to
ride it all the way into the ground and partners with Venezuela to this end.
Lots of kids coming out of business school talk about “doing time” in Texas
while they try to cash in on the situation, but most of them end up limping
back to the East or West coast with lungs full of soot and all strung out on
speed or adderall or modafinil or all three.
