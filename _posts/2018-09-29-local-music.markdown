I've featured tunes from this record already on this blog, but [my friend and producer Salim Nourallah's new record is out.](https://fanlink.to/SSOS) I recommend playing the last tune first, _Tucumcari (Band Version)_.

I got a [quick ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/1873146868) in this morning before the rain started. At one point we had stopped and started rolling again and I had that sense of how amazing riding a bike is; like when I was a kid; and that I don't do it enough. I was curious how much I've ridden on average the last few years. It's pretty abysmal. [1.6 ave rides per week; 0.9 hours per ride](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jJR08Gryikgd7yWx-f5-0ZCpIHgl5EyZlayMxBU5MTs/edit?usp=sharing). I wish I could ride more; I need to ride more.

[Facebook got hacked in a major way](https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-security-breach-third-party-sites/), including access to any sites you logged into via Facebook.

>On Friday, Facebook revealed that it had suffered a security breach that impacted at least 50 million of its users, and possibly as many as 90 million. What it failed to mention initially, but revealed in a followup call Friday afternoon, is that the flaw affects more than just Facebook. If your account was impacted it means that a hacker could have accessed any account that you log into using Facebook.

>The debacle also underscores broader concerns about Single Sign-On, which Friday turned into the ultimate object lesson in the inherent tradeoffs between security and convenience.

As if [everything else wrong with Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjPYmEZxACM) wasn't enough.
