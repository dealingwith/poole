* Simplify * He who owns little is little owned * Smaller, smaller * Do only
what you love, love everything that you do * Underpromise, overdeliver *
Embrace constraints * Less * Business is personal—not an abstraction * Honor
your mistake as a hidden intention * Disrupt business as usual * Storytelling
* Nobody knows what they really want before they get it

* Checkbox and asterisk: Indicates open task that is urgent * Checkbox and
“f/u:” Indicates an open task that needs additional follow-up before I can
complete it. * Checkbox and circled letter: Indicates that an open task needs
to be performed in a specific location. Adding the location makes the list
easy to scan to chunk potential errands. (“T” below indicates that the three
tasks must all be performed at Target, for example.)
