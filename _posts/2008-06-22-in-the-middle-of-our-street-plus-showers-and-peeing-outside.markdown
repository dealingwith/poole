The new house is so big the child is afraid of the hallway.

It looks like we'll survive our Weekend Without Water. Lots of hand sanitizer
and gallon jugs of water. We are really looking forward to our first shower in
the new house, though. We are really hopeful that the city men will start to
work really early tomorrow and we'll be first on the list, so at 8 when it's
time to get ready to ride the train to work, there might be the option to
shower etc. And yes, I have been very tempted to go find the connection with
the largest wrench I have.

A **bunch** of little details to take care of during the week. Like how there
are no grounded outlets in the office. The things you don't notice when you're
looking at places.

I am pretty scared of what the electricity bill is going to be like this
summer.

We're off to clean our respective old apartments now. Tonight we're going to
go down a list of friends by location looking for a place to bum a quick
shower to last us until tomorrow (me until tomorrow night unless our above
hopes are fulfilled).
