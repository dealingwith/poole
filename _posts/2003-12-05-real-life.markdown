Just had some meatspace time with two amazing minds that informed so much of what is going on in the world right now, and of course what is going on specifically in my life. Affirming. The kind of thing that can only occur offline.



Probably going to do some work in this space about art, what it means to be an artist, a prophet, and how that positions you in this world.



It ain't easy. But you don't have a choice.



It's like the choice between having a soft heart and a hard heart. It's like the choice between love and ambivilence. It's like the choice between being driven for some higher purpose or just letting things go.



Like I said, it ain't easy. Most people choose the later on all those.



But for those of us who don't really have a choice, this work is for you.
