<i>Comment.minutia.GB02:</i> <b>Jon McGregor</b>

<a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/bookerprize2002/story/0,12350,777549,00.html">Guardian Unlimited Books | Special Reports | Portrait: Jon McGregor</a>

Jon McGregor was a speaker whose talk I attended at Greenbelt. Afterwards, I went to the bookstore and bought his book, which he then signed. I told him I would talk about it on the site when I started reading it. I have no idea if he's even been to the site or (and certainly not this one) had the patience to see if I would ever start reading it. Well, it's very next in the queue; I hope to start it in the next day or two; and this review has VERY much wet my appetite.

He didn't make the short list for the Booker Prize, but that long list isn't very long, now is it?
