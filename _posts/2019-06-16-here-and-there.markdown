I enjoy riding my bike a lot! I really do. I just suck at selfies.

[Thereabouts](http://www.thereabouts.com.au/) make amazing films about epic bike rides, like this one.

There's even a soundtrack.

[Lachlan Morton](https://www.instagram.com/LachlanMorton/) is probably my favorite pro cyclist of the moment. He not only races the pro calendar for the Education First cycling team, but does things like Thereabouts with his brother, and things like the Dirty Kanza:

[People are sick of drinking. Investors are betting on the 'sober curious'](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/08/tech/alcohol-alternative-sober-curious/index.html)

The alternative-to-booze products mentioned in the article seem like nonsense to me, but a good trend nonetheless.

>Leaning in to pain can be powerful if you have the agency and ability to change it, or practice it to mastery, or even just adapt your own emotional responses to it.  If you don’t or you can’t, leaning in to pain will kill you.  Having the wisdom to know the difference is everything.
