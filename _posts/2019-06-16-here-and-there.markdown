I enjoy riding my bike a lot! I really do. I just suck at selfies.

[People are sick of drinking. Investors are betting on the 'sober curious'](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/08/tech/alcohol-alternative-sober-curious/index.html)

>Leaning in to pain can be powerful if you have the agency and ability to change it, or practice it to mastery, or even just adapt your own emotional responses to it.  If you don’t or you can’t, leaning in to pain will kill you.  Having the wisdom to know the difference is everything.
