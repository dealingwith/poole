Joel Hooks, who I've mentioned [here]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/04/17/joel-hooks-on-indie-hackers.html) and didn't mention [here]({{site.baseurl}}/2018/06/24/pdx-2018.html "But that's who we were visiting"), was recently [on the Indie Hackers podcast](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/075-joel-hooks-of-egghead), and he had some really great things to share. I heartily recommend giving it a listen.
