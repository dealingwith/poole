tons of pictures scanned from last europe trip, san fran trip, hate mail show, and people (3) for whom i did photoshoots last weekend plus old people shots

important for the grant chances but also for myself to really pin down my recent visions about the role of my life in social action and activism, community building, and art

still pursuing a music project that will mesh my recent songwriting with dance styles and dynamic vocals
still recording the songs themselves for the first stage of this project to begin
still trying to play out at open mics whenever possible to at least be up there and warm up these songs in front of people
