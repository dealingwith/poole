_Focusing on something for 5 minutes, much less for an entire month, is
difficult though. I'm just not very good at motivating myself about some
things--it's almost easier to find a way to trick myself into believing that I
don't need to be motivated. Do things by not trying to make yourself do them--
do them the Tyler Durden way, while you're not paying attention, while you're
sleeping._
