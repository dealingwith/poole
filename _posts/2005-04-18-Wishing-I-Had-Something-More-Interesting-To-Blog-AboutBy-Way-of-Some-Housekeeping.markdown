If anyone has any of my VHS/DVD's, Chuck Palahniuk books, or Mike Riddell books, could you please return them sometime soon? Anyone with the new Iron and Wine wanna put it on the mediashare?



I was a little concerned when I <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/blog/index.php?file=2005_04.xml&id=05103943">posted that picture of dogs humping</a> that someone would think one of them was my dog, Pavlov. Of course, I haven't mentioned my dog yet, <a href="http://www.theyblinked.com/blog/2005/03/daniel-just-looked-at-me-and-said-in.html">only Dan has</a>. I got him from the <a href="http://www.spca.org">SPCA</a> in January. He's a 36lbs chocolate lab/chow/whatever mix and mostly a lot of trouble.
Here's a picture of him, looking much meaner than he is, playing with his best friend in the world, Perlican:
