Lauryn Hill: 


<blockquote><a href="http://bonniesweb.tripod.com/lauryn.html#forgive">Father Forgive Them</a>


Forgive them father for they know not what they do

Forgive them father for they know not what they do



Beware the false motives of others

Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers

And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you, to you

They say all the right things to gain their position

Then use your kindness as their ammunition

To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do



Forgive them father for they know not what they do

Forgive them father for they know not what they do



Why every Indian wanna be the chief?

Feed a man 'til he's full and he still want beef

Give me grief, try to tief off my piece

Why for you to increase, I must decrease?

If I treat you kindly does it mean that I'm weak?

You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets

I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek

But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik

And other African czars observing stars with war scars

Get yours in this capitalistic system

So many caught or got bought you can't list them

How you gonna idolize the missing?

To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition

Even when they comin' gunnin'

I stand position

L's known the mission since conception

Let's free the people from deception

If you looking for the answers

Then you gotta ask the questions

And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto

Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto

Why black people always be the ones to settle

March through these streets like Soweto



Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus, Jesus and Judas,

Backstabbers do this



Forgive them father for they know not what they do

Forgive them father for they know not what they do



It took me a little while to discover

Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers

Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves

A friend once said, and I found to be true

That everyday people, they lie to God too

So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you



Forgive them father for they know not what they do

Forgive them, forgive them

Forgive them father for they know not what they do

Forgive them, forgive them</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://bonniesweb.tripod.com/lauryn.html#used">I Used to Love Him</a>



As I look at what I've done

The type of life that I've lived

How many things I pray the father will forgive

One situation involved a young man

He was the ocean and I was the sand

He stole my heart like a thief in the night

Dulled my senses blurred my sight



I used to love him but now I don't

I used to love him but now I don't



I chose a road of passion and pain

Sacrificed too much and waited in vain

Gave up my power ceased being queen

Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend



Torn and confused wasted and used

Reached the crossroad which path would I choose

Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated

For something to happen that just wasn't fated

Thought what I wanted was something I needed

When momma said no I just should have heeded

Misled I bled till the poison was gone

And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn



I used to love him but now I don't

I used to love him but now I don't



Father you saved me and showed me that life

Was much more than being some foolish man's wife

Showed me that love was respect and devotion

Greater than planets deeper than oceans

My soul was weary but now it's replenished

Content because that part of my life is finished



I see him sometimes and the look in his eye

Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold

But my heart is gold I took back my soul

And totally let my creator control

The life which was his to begin with



I used to love him but now I don't</blockquote>Poe:<blockquote><a href="http://www.alwaysontherun.net/poe.htm#h2">Haunted</a>



Come here

Pretty please

Can you tell me where I am

You won't you say something

I need to get my bearings

I'm lost

And the shadows keep on changing



And I'm haunted

By the lives that I have loved

And actions I have hated

I'm haunted

By the lives that wove the web

Inside my haunted head</blockquote<blockquote><a href="http://www.alwaysontherun.net/poe.htm#h3">Control</a>



Don't you mess with a little girl's dream

'Cause she's liable to grow up mean



Surprised you to find that I'm laughing?

You thought that you'd find me in tears

You thought I'd be crawling the walls

Like a tiny mosquito and trembling in fear



Well you may be king for the moment

But I am a queen understand

And I've got your pawns and your bishops

And castles

All inside the palm of my hand



While you were looking the other way

While you had your eyes closed

While you were licking your lips

'Cause I was miserable

While you were selling your soul

While you were tearing a hole in me



I was taking control



Now I have taken control

Now I have taken control...



This is beginning to feel good

Watching you squirm in your shoes

A small bead of sweat on your brow

And a growl in your belly you're scared to let through



You thought you could keep me from loving

You thought you could feed on my soul

But while you were busy destroying my life

What was half in me has become whole</blockquote>Poe is a very interesting (and beautiful) cat. She's apparently just come out of a long legal battle with her record label and is doing the independent thing. I think she is a precedent-setter, and I think we will see more small-but-big-enough-to-have-a-go-of-it acts following suit. The kind of acts you will see succeed are the ones with their own authentic ethos, the kind of something that retains fans, connects with them on a deeper level, keeps them coming out to shows and buying discs even when the market is weak and over-saturated.



To describe what she went through, and also as a condemnation on the industry as a whole, <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/gallery/ramblings/thepsycho.htm">Poe wrote a story</a>. It is really good, I recommend reading it through.



Poe is the one who is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375703764/qid=1070607305/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-0762212-5100949">Danielewski's</a> sister (of course we all heard of Poe first with her 1995 hit, whatever it was!), and her last record, Haunted, is a concept album around House of Leaves (as well as dealing with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0199756/">her father's</a> death...a soundbyte from him at the end of <em>Control</em> is amazing). In fact, they went on tour together, a combo book/music tour. Found more pictures from that today <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/DM/Chapter1/04.html">here</a> (Mark), <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/DM/Chapter1/05.html">here</a> (masks depicting Tad which somehow were used to set off the recordings used on the records, live), <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/DM/Chapter1/08.html">here</a> (more Mark), <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/DM/Chapter1/11.html">here</a> (Mark with a venti Starbucks), <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/DM/Chapter1/16.html">here</a> (Mark and Poe at the public library), <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/DM/Chapter1/17.html">here</a> (backstage at Jay Leno, Mark is looking <em>tre cool</em> but I don't think he was actually on the show, must just have been his Hollywood look), and <a href="http://www.realpoe.com/updates/14.html">here</a> (this guy read, from memory we presume, the entire HoL quote from the special version of <em>Hey Pretty</em> {that we only found at Salon back when we were reading the book}{from a search of my archives, I apparently never blogged about the book or those files, despite a memory for doing just such}{the one where Mark reads from the book in between sections of the song}, during a Poe concert!). Lots more good pics and stories if you surf around there a bit. Poe's <a href="http://starfileonline.com/lrgoutput/PoeXX031017R307.jpg">looking darn good these days</a> and even <a href="http://starfileonline.com/lrgoutput/PoeXX031017R306.jpg">has some ninja moves</a>.
