Here is the commentary that played in my head during this video:

0:35: Aw how sweet. 0:51: HA! SWEET! 1:10: Oh. She's really good. 2:00: Well
Margot is going to have her work cut out for her. 2:15: OH THE BOA! THE BOA
MAKES THE WHOLE THING! 2:45: How is she making the drum sequences fire and
changing sounds? Is it one long drum sequence? 3:00-4:00: Ok. She's REALLY
good. 4:45: God this is a long song. Prog rock makes really good organ music,
though!
