Besides the dog, the other rash<a href="index.php?file=2005_04.xml&id=21134256">*</a> purchase of 2005 has been a rather large painting by the amazing Dallas-based painter Nicholas Mathis. I kinda did a deal and am developing <a href="http://pigeonstoneproject.com/">pigeonstoneproject.com</a> as partial payment. But it was still a lot of money. Is a lot of money...I'm still paying it off...right now in books Nic has requested. But then my first payment on it went straight towards his rent...literally.



But it is so worth it. I'm just worried that when I move I won't have a wall large enough to hang it on.



Here is a shot that has the piece in context:

This is a classic photograph of Nic that is part of Sarah Jane's <a href="http://www.sarahjanesemrad.com/shows/cat_continental_gallery.html">current show</a>:
