			I got a cul email from a cul <a href="http://living-room.blogspot.com">guy</a> in Australia who had a cul <a href="http://living-room.blogspot.com/2002_12_01_living-room_archive.html#85616854">post</a> about a cul <i>marketing campaign</i> (can you <i>believe</i> it?). It is closer to <a href="/miriam">Miriam's blog</a>'s ethos, so <a href="http://www.danielsjourney.com/miriam/2002_12_01_archives.html#85644711">she posted it today</a>.



That first sentence sounds like a line in a Dashboard song I've covered in the past.
