I got a cool email from a cool <a href="http://living-room.blogspot.com">guy</a> in Australia who had a cool <a href="http://living-room.blogspot.com/2002_12_01_living-room_archive.html#85616854">post</a> about a cool <i>marketing campaign</i> (can you <i>believe</i> it?). It is closer to Miriam's blog's ethos, so she posted it today.

That first sentence sounds like a line in a Dashboard song I've covered in the past.
