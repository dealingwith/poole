The main thing that struck me about <a href="http://www.gracecathedral.org/enrichment/forum/for_20010325.shtml">the Trickster interview</a> <a href="http://www.integrationresearch.org/gravatt/">Scott</a> found a few days ago was that the pastor/priest doing the interview sounds almost exactly like <a href="http://vaux.net/">Kester</a> (his voice not necessarily what he says), who originally told me about the book a year and a half ago.



If you might be interested in reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0374279284/qid=1074797842//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/002-7541289-9183229?v=glance&s=books&n=507846">Trickster</a> and participating in a trans-geographic virtual/meatspace continuing installation around themes explored within, please contact Scott or I. We originally planned on doing this, but our initial sense of interest within our communities indicated that most people are not up for such an intense literary experience ATM. It would require actually <em>reading</em> the book, on some schedule. It would also involve a meatspace commitment to exploring its themes.
