<font color="#336699">Later that night, as brother and I were still laid out on the couch watching pay-per-view, there was a knock at the door, and upon opening the door, we were treated to the sight of two <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/hi/english/boxing/default.stm">knockouts</a>. These two blond bombshells in extremely tight, short dresses actually knew our names and quickly introduced themselves as friends. It was like the movies, or a dream.

They hung out with us for a couple hours, talking and flirting like crazy. I felt alive again, amazingly alive, their attention filling back up my empty fuel cells like a Texas power station. Brother and I soaked it in, brother obviously more experienced at this type of thing than I. He made his move and before I knew it he had one of the girls in his bedroom for the night. 

I was not so adept, nor sure about what was reality and what fantasy. Two nights prior I had choked down generic baked beans for the two-hundredth time. Tonight I had a beautiful woman touching my thigh. My heart was pounding again, but my head was also spinning. I started to get lightheaded. In an awkward string of excuses and strange body language, I saw the potential fulfillment of years of sexual frustration, a perfect body and an undoubtedly amazing lover, out the door. She smiled politely and went, I can only assume, home to her studio apartment.
