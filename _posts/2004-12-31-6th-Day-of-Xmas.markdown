SmartCommons doesn't intend to replace or directly compete with <a href="http://evite.com">Evite</a> or <a href="http://meetup.com">MeetUp</a> or the many other excellent offerings in this space. Really, SmartCommons Events are more like the bulletin board at the VFW hall or the monthly newsletter from your Masjid...but with a twist. <a href="http://integrationresearch.org/node/view/55">The twist is that you can associate your posts so that they are only seen by certain segments of your commons...</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.theyblinked.com/blog/2004/12/december-30th-sixth-day-of-christmas.html">SmartCommons Tip #2</a>: When you create a SmartCommons Event that is associated with a Community, Project or Person you can mark the event as a "SmartMob" at the time of creation and SmartCommons will immediately send an event alert to the people associated with the Event.

Tick this box and the item is added to your Collection.*



It is that simple. Try it.



*You have to have Amazon synchronization set up in your SmartCommons Settings. See The Third Day of Christmas for more on this.</blockquote>
