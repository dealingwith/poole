The Sixth Day of Christmas: Remaining Men Together

<blockquote>There are a lot of event planning and notification services out there. SmartCommons doesn't intend to replace or directly compete with <a href="http://evite.com">Evite</a> or <a href="http://meetup.com">MeetUp</a> or the many other excellent offerings in this space. Really, SmartCommons Events are more like the bulletin board at the VFW hall or the monthly newsletter from your Masjid...but with a twist. The twist is that you can associate your posts so that they are only seen by certain segments of your commons...</blockquote>

<blockquote>SmartCommons Tip #2: When you create a SmartCommons Event that is associated with a Community, Project or Person you can mark the event as a "SmartMob" at the time of creation and SmartCommons will immediately send an event alert to the people associated with the Event. (No, I couldn't come up with a term better than Howard Rheingold's).</blockquote>

And earlier:

<blockquote>SmartCommons Tip #1: Did you know that you can add something to your SmartCommons Collection directly from Amazon? When you are signed into Amazon and are on a product page you will notice in the left menu about half way down the page a little check box that is labeled, "I own it." Tick this box and the item is added to your Collection.*

It is that simple. Try it.

*You have to have Amazon synchronization set up in your SmartCommons Settings. See The Third Day of Christmas for more on this.</blockquote>
