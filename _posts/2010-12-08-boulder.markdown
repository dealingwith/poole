title: "&#9829; Boulder"
---

Had the opportunity to visit Boulder, CO, for the first time last week and I immediately fell in love. From the [tacos](http://www.illegalpetes.com/) to the somehow always excellent [espresso](http://tridentcafe.com/) to the fancy drinks to the mountains. Mostly the mountains. Since moving away from Tucson at the end of 1997 I've only been in the (real) mountains a couple of times, and I'd forgotten how good they are for my soul. 

Now I have a huge city crush on Boulder and am trying to figure out how to move there so I can go up into those mountains whenever I need sanity, peace or comfort.
