[My Map][1] from [Christopher Baker][2] on [Vimeo][3].

> Email became an integral part of my life in 1998. Like many people, I have
archived all of my email with the hope of someday revisiting my past. I am
interested in revealing the innumerable relationships between me, my
schoolmates, work-mates, friends and family. This could not readily be
accomplished by reading each of my 60,000 emails one-by-one. Instead, I
created My Map, a relational map and alternative self portrait. My Map is a
piece of custom designed software capable of rendering the relationships
between myself and individuals in my address book by examining the TO:, FROM:,
and CC: fields of every email in my email archive. The intensity of the
relationship is determined by the intensity of the line. My Map allows me to
explore different relational groupings and periods of time, revealing the
temporal ebbs and flows in various relationships. In this way, My Map is a
veritable self-portrait, a reflection of my associations and a way to locate
myself.
