I am officially in the market for a PDA. Anyone have a good or bad experience
with one, a recommendation or a "definitely don't get this one"? Anyone have
one they want to unload?

This is what I'll want to run: -- A spreadsheet. Preferably Excel. -- A PIM.
Preferably Outlook or something that will connect to Outlook *very* easily. --
WiFi preferred. Any PDA's have smart browsers? -- i.e. a browser that knows
how to parse a page designed for the web so it looks better on the PDA? Did I
just discover a market? I really have no idea how you could go about this, but
you could start by changing multiple collumns to one (moving rightmost
collumns under leftmost, for example), not letting anything specify a width
wider than the PDA's resolution, etc. -- As small and simple and cheap as
possible with the above features. I don't need a phone. I don't need anything
else...I will be happy if in the future I discover another need and find a
feature that fulfills it, however in the meantime additional features need to
stay out of my way.
