[Griffin*][3]

Originally uploaded by [Bad Album Covers - volume 2][4].

between this and The Postmark*'s forthcoming record, I'm pretty inspired to
recreate a classic cheeseballsic** cover for my next one (unless my artist
actually gets back to me). my backup source material is already [this][5], not
a far cry...


* SoFla band I heard about today. Tried just now to Google them and/or find
their MySpace page (which I was at earlier today on a diff machine)...no dice!
Don't get me started about the UI abortion that is MySpace!
