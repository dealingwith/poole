For a while I've been meaning to cover <a href="http://christianpornmachine.com">CPM</a>'s Last Rose. I think mostly because there is line/word in the song inspired by yours truly ("americana") and also 'cause "back in high school // when punk was still cool // but nothing lasts forever" is a very cool lyric.



So last week I set about figuring it out and then putting it into a key I could work with. Today I, just for kicks, present the ultra-low-fi, really-i-mean-looooow-fi, mono, americana project version of "Last Rose" by CPM:
