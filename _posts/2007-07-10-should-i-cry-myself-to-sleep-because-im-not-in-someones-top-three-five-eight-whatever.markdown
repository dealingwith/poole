> Now here we are living in the middle of William Gibson's envisioned
Cyberspace and now you're an outcast if you don't have a Myspace page,
Facebook account and who the hell knows what else that I, at an elderly
thirty-six, don't know about. And that's fine, I don't need to pretend I'm
Forever 21 nor do I have a desire to relive those underwhelming, per-pressure,
fueled weird years.

Now I find myself in new awkward territory with more and more requests by
other business owners, peers, and professionals to become "friends" inside
these same social sites and I don't quite fully grok this new layer of
"networking". Does it really matter that I've posted a note on someone's page?
Are we missing out on some large contract because Airbag is on Virb but not
MySpace? Should I cry myself to sleep because I'm not in someone's top three,
five, eight, whatever? Second Life sucks--oops, can I say that with my outside
voice and not be an outcast?
