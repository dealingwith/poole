I drove to Oklahoma City and back so I listened to more podcasts than usual. Here are three good ones from the trip:

[Winning at the Self-publishing Game with Hugh Howey](https://fs.blog/hugh-howey/)

>If you can just maintain that consistent energy in one direction, it’s incredible what you could deflect over a long period of time. And for me, just one hour a day of writing, you’ll write a novel in a year guaranteed, and if you don’t care about the quality of that novel, it’ll be better than you think.

[Managing at My Worst and at My Best: Paul and Rich on Decision Making as a Leader](https://postlight.com/trackchanges/podcast/managing-at-my-worst-and-at-my-best-paul-and-rich-on-decision-making-as-a-leader)

>Here’s the key. I can unlock this for people on the other side of the table. You are team slash discipline oriented. You are oriented around being a designer, an engineer, a product manager, a data analyst, a business analyst. The person on the other side of the table making the unreasonable demand is business oriented. 

>They might come from your discipline. They might have empathy for it but they are reacting not to the goals and needs of the discipline but to the goals and needs of the business that they have agreed to internalize in exchange for like money and privilege and to have part of their life ruined by the company... So you’re there going like, “This is not how you do design. This is not what good engineering looks like.”
