[Hedwig - Midnight Radio][1]

The second of three acts of the Johnny Citizen show ends with a cinematic
version of I'm Here* ...I think I'm going to have to figure out a way to
transition into the ending of this tune ([ref][2]).

The next Hedwig tunes are from [Wig in a Box][3], the Hedwig tribute compiled,
I've been told, by Dallas' own [Tim DeLaughter][4].**

[Wicked Little Town (The Breeders)][5]

and of course [The Origin of Love (Rufus Wainwright)][6]

* A new tune only a few people have heard.

** [Not true][7]. Still, Tim is one of my favorite people in the world.
Seriously. I wish to get to know him IRL someday.
