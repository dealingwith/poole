I have a strange anxiety with this blog that if I leave a really sad post up too long I'm putting bad energy out there, and if I leave a happier post up too long people might get the wrong impression about how well we're (not) doing. I stumbled across this Warren Zevon song yesterday in a folder full of mp3s that I've had lying around forever. It felt like it struck a nice middle ground. A reminder of reality, but with a dose of good, sardonic humor. We can always use a little comedy with our tragedy. Lord knows we can use some f-bombs to describe it.*

<p class="postscript">* Unless the f-bomb really offends you, then you should not listen to this song. It sort of features it.</p>
