It's a long thread I shant explain, but I had to post _Hide Away_ by [Adam Again][2], the band that wrote the song (_Dig_) that inspired Don't Tell Me, and from which Don't Tell Me stole lyrics for the outro.

While I'm at it, _It's All Right_.

And shit, _Relapse_.

...and _Good Cop Bad Cop_ by _Everything But the Girl_.
