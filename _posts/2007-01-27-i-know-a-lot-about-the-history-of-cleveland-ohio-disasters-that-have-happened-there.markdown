It's a long thread I shant explain, but I had to post [Hide Away][1] by [Adam
Again][2], the band that wrote the song (Dig) that inspired Don't Tell Me, and
from which Don't Tell Me stole lyrics for the outro.

While I'm at it, here's [It's All Right][3].

And shit, [Relapse][4].

And I uploaded [Good Cop Bad Cop][5] by Everything But the Girl a while back
but never posted it.
