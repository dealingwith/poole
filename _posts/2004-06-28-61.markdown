OMG I'm so tired all the freakin time I can't figure out what's wrong.

OMG I'm so tired of hearing about the Polyphonic Spree every damn day of my
life.

OMG I don't ever want to hear about another television program again in my
life.

OMG I saw Farenheit yesterday and it made me cry. I'm also afraid that God's
going to hear that Iraqi mother's prayer and take her revenge on the US.

That last part was serious.
