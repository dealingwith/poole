[via ehampton][1], learned that Karadzic was arrested! Very good news! But my
first question was "How?" It's not like there has been a lack of resources on
the job for the last 13 years. The following article helped answer that
question a little bit.

[Karadzic arrest signals new direction][2]:

> Radovan Karadzic has spent his first night in a cell at the special war
crimes court in Belgrade, after 13 years on the run.

This was the arrest many people in the Balkans and beyond had come to believe
would never happen.

[The Hunting Party][3] is actually a really good movie that is a fictional re-
telling of a real-life reporter's attempt to find Karadzic after the war.
Don't let the Richard Gere part fool you--it really is a great movie! And if
you're curious what this whole business is about, it's a fun way to get caught
up.
