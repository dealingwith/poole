![][1]Now that I've done it, I'll tell you about [laptopgiving.org and One
Laptop Per Child's "Give One, Get One" deal][2]. US/Canada only, and it comes
out to $423.95 with shipping, $200 of which is deductible.

> The mission of One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) is to empower the children of
developing countries to learn by providing one connected laptop to every
school-age child. In order to accomplish our goal, we need people who believe
in what we’re doing and want to help make education for the world’s children a
priority, not a privilege. Between November 12 and November 26, OLPC is
offering a Give One Get One program in the United States and Canada. During
this time, you can donate the revolutionary XO laptop to a child in a
developing nation, and also receive one for the child in your life in
recognition of your contribution.

Whoever thought up this campaign is pretty genius. It works on a number of
psychological and practical levels.
