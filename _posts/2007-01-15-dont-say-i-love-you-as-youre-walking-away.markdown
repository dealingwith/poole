[![][1]][2] [Neko Case - Lion's Jaws][3] _the night I fell into the lion’s
jaws to my regret and your delight those teeth themselves could not divine nor
their pressure estimate the haze I wished you’d never break and to never
contemplate momentum for the sake of momentum_ [#][4]

[Neko Case - Hold On, Hold On][5] _compared to some I've been around but I
really tried so hard that echo chorus lied to me with its: "hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on," in the end I was the mean girl or somebody's in-between
girl now it's the devil I love and that's as funny as real love_ [#][6]
