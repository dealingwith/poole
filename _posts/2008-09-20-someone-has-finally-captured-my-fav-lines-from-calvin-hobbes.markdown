[Quotes: Ask Calvin's Dad][1]. Specifically, this exchange:

> Q. How come old photographs are always black and white? Didn't they have
color film back then? A. Sure they did. In fact, those old photographs are in
color. It's just that the world was black and white then. The world didn't
turn color until sometime in the 1930s, and it was pretty grainy color for a
while, too. Q. But then why are old paintings in color?! If the world was
black and white, wouldn't artists have painted it that way? A. Not
necessarily. A lot of great artists were insane. Q. But... But how could they
have painted in color anyway? Wouldn't their paints have been shades of gray
back then? A. Of course, but they turned colors like everything else did in
the '30s. Q. So why didn't old black and white photos turn color too? A.
Because they were color pictures of black and white, remember?
