ahh this is going to be interesting...big brother is going to video all of us in Jan...[<a href="http://www.washtimes.com/metro/20021220-26599592.htm">more</a>]



i am going to be careful to not stand in any public space when the cops decide to arrest everyone in the city limits...maybe if i wear a suit i can say i'm just an innocent fed employee...nah, probly just make the weekend illegal prison stay less comfortable...
