Western religion (like all religions) is an aesthetic. It used to be the
driving aesthetic of our overall culture. Now it is primarily following
cultural trends. This is how it has failed. Not as a spiritual practice, of
which it is one of many and as relevant as any, but rather in pretending its
spiritual directives ran counter (or at best secondarily) to its cultural
directives.
