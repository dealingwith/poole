Last night I had a dream that I was in Germany and after a soccer game played
with a number of tennis balls I was told I was a good reader. Then [Steve
Collins][5] gave me a fixed-gear bicycle that looked more like the motorcycle
in this picture. I had a fun if harrowing ride on the heavy fixie but then got
lost and also a flat tire. I ended up in a train station trying to find a
German who could speak English well enough to give me directions. This was the
second time recently where a train station was part of a dream. Good stuff. I
liked the riding a weird fixie around part, though. More of that please. Just
no getting lost and flats next time.


Today I had the thought: while it provides drive to do better, the problem
with always being dissatisfied with one's past accomplishments is forgetting
all the amazing stuff you have done in the past, which makes it more difficult
to impress people you are trying to impress.
