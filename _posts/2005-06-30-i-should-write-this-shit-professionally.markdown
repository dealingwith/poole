> Regarding the attached letter dated May 23, 2005: Considering the facts that
the first replacement door opener I was given also did not work, the third
worked only sporadically until the doors base unit itself was recently
repaired, and others in my building also had problems with the door until said
repair, I find your conjecture that the inoperative state of my first door
opener be due to a single drop to be less than incontestable. Of course, you
have my deposit and can draw from it as you will. For me, the cost is the
equivalent of a night out on the town; for your business, it is one lifetimes
worth of referrals and goodwill.
