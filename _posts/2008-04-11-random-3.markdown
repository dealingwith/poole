Looking through old files, looking for the old will which has really needed an
update for a couple years now :P ...found this. It's not lent, but whatever...

> I'm an American, so I don't know much about Lent beyond giving things up
like chocolate and alcohol, a vain attempt at discipline of some sort, really
just further aspirations towards that hierarchy of success that co-opted
Christianity long ago--read your Bible more, go to church more, buy more Left
Behind books, lose weight, elective surgery... And I'm reminded of Tyler's
words

>

>> Self-improvement is masturbation.

> I, for one, have died numerous times over the course of the last 9 months,
and have found Jesus, alcohol, and cigarettes in the process. For me, having
to give anything up for a few weeks, to pretend to be put-out and hardened by
the experience of less Budweiser or Godiva, is interesting. Comedy. It seems
to me that those of us who actually see Christ get most things taken from us
by default. Something like protecting us. Something like kiddy-barriers at the
top of staircases. Something like instant reverse Karma. Nothing at all like a
lack of Nestle in your diet.
