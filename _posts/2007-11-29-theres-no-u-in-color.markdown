[There's no 'u' in 'color.'][1]

> Web copywriters need to [get hired in the first place][2]. Then we* can
enjoy the dubious luxury of going on strike. The picket signs will read
thusly: `</p>`

> Sometimes I don't want to hear hope. Sometimes I want to be snarky in a
different accent and with better shoes. It's the writer in me. Snarkiness is
next to godliness. Sometimes, though, hope just suits me better.

Also, I'm American. And I'm learning to deal with that.
