this is for [_iamjackslj][1] (ref: our IM today) and myself:

Hubert Selby, Jr. talks about why he kept writing, through failing health and
obscurity:

> Writing, like any art, is a continuing process of discovering the infinite
possibilities of Life. A blank piece of paper can be terrifying. It can also
be exciting when ideas, images and sounds come together and sing off the page.
For me there is no other experience like it. When I just touch the keyboard a
part of me comes to life that at one time I did not know existed.
