> Net neutrality has been explained using pizza at least three times. Jason flagged this dead-to-rights analogy by Craigslist founder Craig Newmark from 2006:

>> Let’s say you call Joe’s Pizza and the first thing you hear is a message saying you’ll be connected in a minute or two, but if you want, you can be connected to Pizza Hut right away. That’s not fair, right? You called Joe’s and want some Joe’s pizza. Well, that’s how some telecommunications executives want the Internet to operate, with some Web sites easier to access than others. For them, this would be a money-making regime.

Another good understanding of what this all means can be had by listening to the dissenting opinions from the 3-2 FCC vote:

I have some thoughts on how current political leaders were able to assume power based on populist rhetoric, yet immediately and obviously push for changes that disempower the population in favor of corporations and the wealthy. But I will save those for another post.
