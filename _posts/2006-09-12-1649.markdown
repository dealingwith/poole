> The era of islands is over for most development scenarios. You don't have to
make one definitive choice. Instead, you get to hog all the productivity you
can for the common cases, then outsource the bottlenecks to existing packages
in faster languages or build your own tiny extension when it's needed.

...So please don't let bottlenecks (real or imaginary, usually the latter)
dictate your choice of software development environment. We have a term for
that and it's called premature optimization.
