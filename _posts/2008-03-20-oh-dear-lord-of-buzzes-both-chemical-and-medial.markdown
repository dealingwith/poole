![][1]From [Ad Age][2]:

> Starbucks is also dipping its toe into the world of social networking. Mr.
Schultz acknowledged that the chain has "never had any online presence to
speak of," but hopes that will change with the launch of mystarbucksidea.com.


Chief Technical Officer Chris Bruzzo said the new site will present a variety
of ideas for Starbucks, allow visitors to vote on those ideas, post comments
and make their own suggestions. Votes will be tallied online, and ideas will
be assigned a value in points.

From [Brian Oberkirch][3]:

> I keep hearing horror stories of brands insisting on launching their own
social networks. The short version of this post: don't do it. We really don't
care. Really. We. Don't. Care.

And, um, Starbucks? It's called [Get Satisfaction][4].
