This video made the rounds a few months ago, and for good reason. It starts with some stuff that maybe only nerds can appreciate, but the end is dynamite. If you've already seen it, it's worth a second viewing. If you've never seen it, it's probably because you're not a nerd, and it's worth watching all the way through regardless...
