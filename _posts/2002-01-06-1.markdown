sometimes you just have to disconnect to do anything. i'm always plugged in. reading this. reading that. getting this. hearing about that. experiencing this. seeing that. what's the deal? did you hear? have you seen? didn't you know? ohmygosh! that is so cool! you've GOT to see it! you've GOT to read it!

every day i could spend all day just looking at the stuff i've been sent or been told about or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, or surfed to, 

it's no wonder no-one visits your site

but that's ok cuz then i put whatever in this space

this is my space

and maybe someday, some sicko out there will really connect with it and start reading it.

but i won't know.

and that's cul.
