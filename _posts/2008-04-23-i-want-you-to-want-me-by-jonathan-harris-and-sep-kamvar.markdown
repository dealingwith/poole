> The interactive installation "I Want You To Want Me", by Jonathan Harris and
Sep Kamvar, commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art, for their "Design and
the Elastic Mind" exhibition.


I Want You To Want Me explores the search for love and self in the world of
online dating. It chronicles the world's long-term relationship with romance,
across all ages, genders, and sexualities, using real data collected from
Internet dating sites every few hours.


The piece is presented on a 56" high-resolution touch-screen, hanging
vertically on the wall, and was installed at MoMA on February 14, 2008,
Valentine's Day.
