Back in the mid 90's I lived in Tucson and rode my bicycle quite a bit. The roads out in the desert were constructed in such a way that every six feet or so there was a sizable gap in the pavement. This was so the road surface could expand and contract during the radical daily temperature changes in the desert. It made for a bumpy ride. I thought about those roads while planning the other day.

The more harsh the weather, the more gaps you need to leave in your road(map).
