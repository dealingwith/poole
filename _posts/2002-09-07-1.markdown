<img src="http://www.michaelknott.com/paintings/Images/serenity.jpg" align="left"><a href="http://www.michaelknott.com/merchandise/index.shtml">Michael Knott</a> -- has a new record coming out real soon, and some AMAZING artwork for sale. I know no-one visiting this site buys ART but check it out and make yerself a nice desktop collage or something...

Michael was in rehab for alcoholism last year. I didn't know that, but I guess it is all good now. I was just having a conversation a couple weeks ago about how much he drank at his show in Florida last year. I didn't think much about it, but if that was every day then yeah...

Do send yer good karma his way...
