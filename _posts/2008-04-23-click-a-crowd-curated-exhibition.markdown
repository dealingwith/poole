[Derek Powazek - Click! A Crowd-Curated Exhibition][1]:

> The Brooklyn Museum is holding a crowdsourced art show. They held an open
call for photography on the theme “the changing face of Brooklyn.” They got
hundreds of submissions. Now, the crowd is voting on them. The winners will
appear in the final show, and even be sized according to their vote counts.

Can the crowd be wise enough to curate a gallery show? We’ll see. You can have
your say now through 23 May.
