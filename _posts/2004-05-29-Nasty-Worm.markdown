I got a particularly evil worm housed in a particularly evil socially engineered email.  No it never executed...I just want to warn others who might fall prey to its scheme. It's targeted at people who have their own domains, and I know a lot of people who have domains and might not be keen enough to catch this one. No offense of course. Just looking out for you. The email is a spoofed email warning you about spoofed emails. Here's what mine looked like:<blockquote>----- Original Message -----
