fyi my phone died a couple days ago. i just got a new one. no address book
transfer (different makes) (it may be possible, but i'm sure if it is, it's
not worth the time and hassle). so i don't really care, but if i'm going to
call anyone, you're going to have to call me first so i can get your number
again.
