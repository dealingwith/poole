It's 12:33AM, I just got back from the studio where we cut the first of 4 songs for the EP. The producer showed up in Sarajevo, and he's a decent chap in the end, and a fine producer. Tomorrow we try to get a lot further in the little time I have before my gig at City Pub. Thursday will be the same situation, but hopefully by the end of the weekend recording will be finished. Hopefully no similar roadblocks in the printing of the CD and it should get done in time for GB.
