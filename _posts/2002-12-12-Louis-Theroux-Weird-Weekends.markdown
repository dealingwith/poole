			I interrupt this period of bloglessness to bring you this important announcement. The weekend I was in NYC staying with a friend from the UK, we watched some dvd's of this show, which is also on Bravo. Today on a whim I was checking out the website and found these must-see clips from an episode I'm now dieing to see (hint they have to do with Christianity and Dallas):



<a href="http://www.bravotv.com/series/louis_theroux/episodes/christians/clip_turtle_lofi.html">better than turtle wax</a>

<a href="http://www.bravotv.com/series/louis_theroux/episodes/christians/clip_family.html">not really a christian</a>

<a href="http://www.bravotv.com/series/louis_theroux/episodes/christians/clip_angels.html">angels on your body</a>



from the <a href="http://www.bravotv.com/series/louis_theroux/index2.html">site for the show</a>
