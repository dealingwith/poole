So I finally got to see the new Matrix last night, in a funky theater with loud Bosnians all around (btw, how many people in your theater understood the french part in the middle? --about half the theater did here) and a bad soundsystem, but it was still good. I agree with almost all of <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~smallritual/">Collin's</a> critique, plus some others I've heard: kill the stupid orchestral soundtrack (is that some weird conservatism at the studios?), the Zion sequence was too long and stupid, then after that it got good. I really liked the last half. The explanations/revelations of what's "really" going on were good while still leaving a lot of loose ends to tie up. But I still don't buy for one second that they wrote all three movies at the same time.



Good, could be better, only great because we're all bought into the story pretty thoroughly already.
