> This said, it is pointless trying to decide whether Zenobia is to be
classified among happy cities or among the unhappy. It makes no sense to
divide cities into these two species, but rather into another two: those that
through the years and the changes continue to give their form to desires, and
those in which desires either erase the city or are erased by it.
