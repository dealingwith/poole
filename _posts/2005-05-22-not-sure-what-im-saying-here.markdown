I just read <a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/archives/cognitive_psychology_ia_from_theory_to_practice.php">this article</a> from August 11, 2003 that I printed out to read on March 14, 2004. This is my life.

The rest of this post shall be devoted to pictures of my dog, who is teaching me new things everyday.

This dog's name is <a href="http://leeharveys.com/pages/dogday.html">Ruby and she's the house dog</a> at <a href="http://leeharveys.com/">Lee Harvey's</a>. She wasn't allowed to play with the other dogs for a couple weeks because she bit one a while back. They let her back out the other week, when Pavlov was the only other dog there as of yet. They played like they'd known each other 	forever and she even let Pavlov kick her ass a time or two.
