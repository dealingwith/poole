[john heron project -- Small Music, Beautiful Music][1]

> And then there's Daniel, who records as [**Johnny Citizen**][2]. A good
writer, an artist, a man with a frightening knowledge of technology and a
really strong singing voice. I have owned a treasured copy of Daniel's
_Americana EP_ for a long time, but it's great to know that he has a proper
album now. I've mentioned the album, _Happy Sounding Sad Songs_, before, but
now [you can buy it here][3]. It's fine, bleak, lonely rock music. If that
makes sense. I genuinely like it. I wouldn't be plugging it if I didn't.

These will move over the [**Johnny Citizen**][2] dot come very soon....
