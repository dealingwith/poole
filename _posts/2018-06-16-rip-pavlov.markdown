I got Pavlov from the Dallas SPCA in early 2005, when he was 1 year old. He lived a lot of life with me.

I forgot he used to lay like this until I was looking at old pictures of him.

He was known as the emo dog.

His literal BFF, Ringo. We're worried about how Ringo will handle life without Pav.

He used to keep up with me on mountain bike rides.
