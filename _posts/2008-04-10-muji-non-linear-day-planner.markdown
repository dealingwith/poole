Muji Chronotebook Non-linear Day Planner][2]

> The new Chronotebook day planner takes a different approach to laying out
your tasks and eventsâ€”instead of representing your day in a boring sequence of
lines or on a grid, it displays time on an axis, like an analog clock. Each
page represents either the AM or PM, and you write your plans like spokes on a
bicycle wheel.
