We'll be over 150,000 deaths tomorrow, which is [more United States citizens than died in World War I, or in the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined](/2020/04/25/numbers/).

It feels very much like people just gave up. They were sick of being cooped up at home. They were terrified of what was happening with the economy. So they just said, "F--k it," and went to the bar. Grandma will have to fend for herself.

As the fall semester looms, I wonder what long-term effects our ignorance and impatience will have on us. Unable to go back to school, kids will fall behind their international peers. In 10 years, how many things won't be invented in the United States all because we needed to party and are more prone to believing falsehoods when they support our own individualist narrative.
