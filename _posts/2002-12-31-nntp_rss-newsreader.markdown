My friend Jason Brome has created an open source RSS newsreader that works through your favorite NNTP newsreader (i.e. Outlook Express for me). It is a really great way for me to now integrate my email and blog/news reading in one client app. Here's the <a href="http://methodize.org/">project's homepage</a> and it's <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=68044&release_id=130632">Sourceforge page for download</a>. He's already been mentioned on <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/archives/003441.html#003441">Ben Hammersley.com</a> as well. Screenshot if you go more words:
