This is totally random-upon-random, but [this entry][1] on [ftrain][2] helped
to expand a bit of one of my own songs for me. He quotes [Genesis 11][3]:

> Come, let us go down and confuse

[Our World][4] requests:

> Won't you come in and stay for a while? Won't you come down and see our
broken lives?

The history of God-human relations, as I have come to both learn of and
experience it, is a tumultuous one, with the blame for the friction landing on
neither the deitous nor the mortal. Our World challenges each side: humanity's
lost the plot, combining [Matthew 6:20][5] and [Revelation 21][6] and creating
Wal-Mart. _(We are like the birds pecking at the roadkill on the streets of
heaven; I'll tell you, that's fool's gold.)_ God, for his part, has admitted
to a destructive jealousy, demonstrated a blatant racism, taken empyreal bets
at the expense of his creation. A creation she has so hidden from so as to
have it itself create competing methods of finding; children that stab and
kill each other when they meet in the labyrinth heading different directions
towards the same center.

I had more to say but it's been a day.
