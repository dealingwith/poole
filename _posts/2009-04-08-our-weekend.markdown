[Our Weekend, April 4-5, 2009][1] from [Daniel Miller][2] on [Vimeo][3].

First on Saturday we trained it downtown for our customary bacon and pancakes
at Cindi's.

Then on Sunday we had french toast at home, then drove down to Deep Ellum with
friends for the arts festival there.

Thanks to everyone who hung out and had so much fun with us!
