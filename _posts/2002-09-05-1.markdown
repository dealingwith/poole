<i>By way of introductions</i>

I should probly make mention of a few things:

01. I'm playing at Common Grounds. Music that is. The 20th of this month. September that is. I'm too lazy to update my announcements for it. How many of you actually live in Virginia anyway? Yeah. That's what I thought. I'll be acom...acom...acompia... <a href="http://www.boboroshi.com/">John</a>'s gonna play guitar and stuff too...

02. We also have some misc. merch avail. for the photo showing...some cards handmade by <a href="/miriam">Miriam</a> (this would be a good time to remind you that she's been blogging faithfully and wittingly) and featuring various b/w and color photos from our catalog. 20 clams a pop for a set of 8 cards. Yes that is next to no margin. Believe it.

03. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-broadband. Yes that's right I'm back on the digital fasttrack and have no time to enjoy it.

04. Started Bosnian training yesterday. That means I've had it for two days so far. Already fried. I'm not a big language guy. Yeah. This afternoon I took the MLAT, which is a test of how good a language learner you are. You'll all get a chuckle when I get the results and post them. Two words: Christmas Tree. In fact, Linear Christmas Tree. C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C. It was the 7th circle of hell I kid you not.

So if I seem like I'm getting cheesed off or something, it's not so. It's just my frustration at my own brain's inability to enjoy or learn any language besides English. That one wasn't too much fun either, I must say. I'm having elementary school flashbacks all of a sudden. I was a special kid. Yeah.

This also soaks more than half my day and (as mentioned) leaves my head a bit fried. So if I slowly disappear from the digital space you'll know why. Just pray my physical presense isn't being compromised as well by either spontaneous combustion or a <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1SAM+31:4&language=english&version=NIV&showfn=on&showxref=on">sword of biblical proportions</a>.

Speaking of cheesed off to biblical proportions you should see <a href="http://pub95.ezboard.com/fnextwavefrm21">what mess</a> <a href="http://www.next-wave.org/aug02/my_new_church_pt2.htm">my new article pt 2</a> made over at <a href="http://www.next-wave.org">next-wave.org</a>. Hee hee! (If u happen to be going there, the "what direction" thread is also a negative response to my article.)
