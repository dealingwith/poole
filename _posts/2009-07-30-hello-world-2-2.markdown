Yeah, so [we][3] had a baby, in case you don't follow the [twitters][4],
[facebooks][5], or even my boring old [website][6].

Her name is Margot Rose Miller. She arrived promptly on her due date, July
23rd. Since then, we have been even more unable to be on time for _anything_.



Also, you should download all the mp3s [here][7] if you haven't already. Then
you have to track down all those artists and buy their new records in full.
Because they are all totally worth it.
