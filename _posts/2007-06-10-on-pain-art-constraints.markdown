> Of all the changes of language a traveler in distant lands must face, none
equals that which awaits him in the city of Hypatia, because the change
regards not words, but things. I entered Hypatia one morning, a magnolia
garden was reflected in blue lagoons, I walked among the hedges, sure I would
discover young and beautiful ladies bathing; but at the bottom of the water,
crabs were biting the eyes of the suicides, stones tied around their necks,
their hair green with seaweed.

> ...I could only question the philosophers. I entered the great library, I
became lost among shelves collapsing under the vellum bindings, I followed the
alphabetical order of vanished alphabets, up and down halls, stairs, bridges.
In the most remote papyrus cabinet, in a cloud of smoke, the dazed eyes of an
adolescent appeared to me, as he lay on a mat, his lips glued to an opium
pipe.

> "Where is the sage?"

> The smoker pointed out of the window. It was a garden with children's games:
ninepins, a swing, a top. The philosopher was seated on the lawn. He said:
"Signs form a language, but not the one you think you know."

> _I realized I had to free myself from the images which in the past had
announced to me the things I sought: only then would I succeed in
understanding the language of Hypatia._

> ...And when my spirit wants no stimulus or nourishment save music, I know it
is to be sought in the cemeteries: the musicians hide in the tombs; from grave
to grave flute trills, harp chords answer one another.

> True, also in Hypatia the day will come when my only desire will be to leave.
I know I must not go down to the harbor then, but climb the citadel's highest
pinnacle and wait for a ship to go by up there. But will it ever go by? There
is no language without deceit.
