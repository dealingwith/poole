I had heard this before but it felt particularly pertinent now, so I'm
capturing it here; I still have to read the entire article. [Strategy by
Design][1]:

> We look for people who are so inquisitive about the world that they're
willing to try to do what you do. We call them "T-shaped people." They have a
principal skill that describes the vertical leg of the T -- they're mechanical
engineers or industrial designers. But they are so empathetic that they can
branch out into other skills, such as anthropology, and do them as well. They
are able to explore insights from many different perspectives and recognize
patterns of behavior that point to a universal human need. That's what you're
after at this point -- patterns that yield ideas.
