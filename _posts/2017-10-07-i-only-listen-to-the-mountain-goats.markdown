[I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/ionlylistentothemountaingoats) is about exactly what it says on the tin.

> A collaboration between Night Vale Presents, the Mountain Goats, and Merge Records, I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats is a podcast about what it means to be an artist, what it means to be a fan, and what it means to be, as many people are, both at once.

> The show finds Joseph Fink, creator of Welcome to Night Vale and Alice Isn’t Dead, in conversation with one of his artistic heroes, John Darnielle, singer and songwriter of the Mountain Goats. Season One explores the stories behind the Mountain Goats’ album All Hail West Texas, one song at a time.

I've been a fan of the Mountain Goats since 2003's Tallahassee. Since you could be LiveJournal friends with bassist Peter Hughes and sign up to work their merch table in Norman, Oklahoma by messaging him on the platform. 

The podcast will have an accompanying record of covers.
