So I was simply going back to the beggining of this blog and followed ONE
link, to [cloudmakers][1], which I had checked up on probly a year ago (more I
guess), and found this whole new niche world of "ARG" (which I think is a
pretty funny acronym, but hey).


I don't have time to properly explore all the links I just posted, when I
found context I posted it, just in case these are transient sites. Perhaps I
will have time to explore more, but if these things interest you and you find
more stuff, please leave comments or email me.
