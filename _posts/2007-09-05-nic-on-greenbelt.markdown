> Just returned from that temporary autonomous zone, Greenbelt– and feeling
somewhat dis(placed)...

It’s a Gentle place, queasily utopian.

...it negates space and generates place...Greenbelt is weirdly ethereal...it
has this tent-like quality, it is defined by whoever comes and where it
decides to pitch camp, it produces its own space and generates its own unique
habitat.

As it happens, this year the weather and human agency constructed a great
festival.
