The main thought that I had during the ceremony (besides the obvious pride for Miriam), was that despite all our cynicism about this nation and its culture, we (I mean you reading and me writing) are out here because we DO care, and we DO believe in each other, and we DO want to make things better. By exposing the wrong we might make room for the right. And the fact of the matter is, is that a lot of the people in gov, and most of the people coming in (like Miriam) are <i>amazing people</i> doing <i>the best job they can for good</i>. So while I stand here in two rather awkward, almost cowardly positions, writing and taking pictures, but actually not getting kicked in the chest, it is easy to think I judge a lot. But this is why I will continue to strive to tell the little stories of humanity that beautifully confuse rather than horribly tidy up. This is why I will work not just for whatever America is working for ATM, but for the overarching values that brought us this far in history...freedom, love, beauty, meaning.
