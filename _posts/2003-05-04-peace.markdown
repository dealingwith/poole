Last night I lay in bed awake for at least two and a half hours. This is not something that ever happens to me. But the cool part is that the entire time I had amazing thoughts -- very specific, future-thinking ideas about how things are to go. This is not something that happens very often to me, and never to this extent.



Call it what you will, but it definately did not come from me.



Peace, patience, determination, joy. Thanks.
