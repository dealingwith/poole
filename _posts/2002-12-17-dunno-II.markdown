I don't have anything against Andrew Jones or anything, but I don't know why he continues to <a href="http://tallskinnykiwi.blogspot.com/">link</a> (and call me 'dan') to the really <a href="http://dealingwith.blogspot.com/">old</a> me, even in <a href="http://net.artax.cz/kingdom/blog.html">new sites he sets up</a>, when he obviously never visits; cuz if he did, he'd realize I'd moved the blog to here about 6 months ago. I even emailed him about it a month ago. goodgrief.
