...this isn't really a daily feature, but i didn't feel like making each of these a seperate post:



<a href="http://www.wellspring.com/russianark/home.html">Russian Ark</a>: A film about time travel cut in one continuous shot. Oh yeah. Coming to the DC area the 31st.



...



Stopped by the used record store today and the sale bin was busting with interesting titles. I got <u title="for those interested, they were: matthew sweet, girlfriend; the innocence mission, glow; luscious jackson, natural ingredients; bruce springsteen, the ghost of tom joad; depeche mode, violator; wild colonials, fruits of life; phil collins, face value">a few</u>.



Maybe it's a sign of getting older, that my music tastes lean towards the chilled, but I am really digging the <a href="http://www.theinnocencemission.com/">Innocence Mission</a>. You can <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/105/innocence_mission.html">stream their stuff from mp3.com</a>. Really into this band, but I'm afraid they won't be playing out before we leave country.
