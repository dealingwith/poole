What I love about technology is how/when a technology creates a positive
innovation feedback loop. Like how a [novel user interface controller][1]
(combined with internet accessibility and the ability to run as a local web
server) creates a burst of [creative hacks][2] so quickly after its release. I
guess another way to look at it is as an innovation tipping point. Change the
way one seemingly solved problem is addressed and all of a sudden...
