So now that I'm caught up on Lost, I'm wondering why I didn't hear any uproar
from Christians about the latest episode, given the way it seems one of the
main elements of the Lost world runs totally counter to Xian worldview. I know
there are some evangelicals out there totally into the show; were they all too
busy being up in arms about how our government wants to help protect the
widowed and orphaned to notice how a huge cultural development is attacking
the core of their religion? Is there going to be some tie-in to western
religious thought, or is there some other religion (or mix of religions) that
Lost seems to be drawing from?
