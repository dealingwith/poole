> green green youth what about the sweetness we knew what about what's good,
what's true from those days

can't count to all the lovers i've burned through so why do i still burn for
you i can't say

[#][3] Haven't done an mp3 of the day for a while, and am planning on
permanently getting out of the habit. But this song's played about three times
this afternoon and I can't get enough.

[Sun Kill Moon - Carry Me Ohio][4]

Besides Sun Kill Moon, I've also been listening to a ton of Nick Drake today
and just continued to be blown. away. omg.
