[Sun Kill Moon--Carry Me Ohio][2]

> green green youth what about the sweetness we knew what about what's good,
what's true from those days

> can't count to all the lovers i've burned through so why do i still burn for
you i can't say

...this song's played about three times this afternoon and I can't get enough.

Besides Sun Kill Moon, I've also been listening to a ton of Nick Drake today and just continued to be blown. away. omg.
