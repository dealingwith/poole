[Perla Is Mean][1]

> Penn is 4 years old. A girl at his school, Perla, makes fun of him. Written
and recorded on the iSight in about 5 minutes.


[The Peanut Butter Song][2] from [Daniel Miller][3] on [Vimeo][4].

> This one was a little bit longer in the writing, but shorter in the making
(the TAG made me record it, again just on the iSight {in case that wasn't
obvious}, while she sleeps on the couch).

The "Peanut Butter Game" is a nightly ritual in our house, where we see what
gross things we can pair with peanut butter. The lists are endless, the song
only touches on a couple in the second verse (anyone who knows about my band-
aid phobia knows how hard it was for me to sing that line)! The song came
about at the genesis of the game, and primarily consisted of the last verse,
as we tried to get the kid to go to sleep.
