The final (green) straw:

Saw "I Am Sam" last night. A movie that could have made it into my top 10, maybe even top 5, but a film ruined by the disgustingly blatent product placement. The whole thing starts with at least 10 individual images of the Starbucks logo and it sure doesn't stop there. Otherwise a really good movie; too bad the first 2/3rds was like a huge Starbucks advert. Once Penn's character quit Starbucks the movie really improved. Even had one of those emotionally cathartic moments of crying uncontrollably (thanks to Michelle's character, actually).
