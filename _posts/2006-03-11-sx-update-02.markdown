Last night at midnight went to [This Film Is Not Yet Rated][1] which was
excellent. Missed my chance to see [Thank You For Smoking][2], will have to
catch that one in theatres. The line for _Rated_ was so long though, I don't
want to know how crazy _Smoking_ was.

Sitting in the Platinum Louge at the moment. The SX wireless network was
dropping me constantly, over here I'm picking up another open one that...is
also dropping me constantly! I think I'm going to rebuild this laptop when I
get back to Dallas. I think it might be me, what with the network problems at
home etc. And the main reason I've hesitated is mostly moot -- my development
environment being mostly setup on the tower, except for [Putty][3] and all my
[CVS][4] stuff, which isn't working on the laptop anymore either for some
reason.

Anyhoo, free coffee and water which is very good for my still hungover self. I
can't even focus well on far away things because I'm so dehydrated. Just went
to [How to Do Precisely the Right Thing at All Possible Times][5] which was
ok. Meant to go to a 10 o'clock session but slept until 10:30. Now just
killing time before [the opening keynote][6], then I'm off to [BarCamp
Austin][7]. Wanted to see [How to Create Passionate Users][8] but it might not
be worth the trip back to the convention center from BarCamp. Will see.
