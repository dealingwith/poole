When I said <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/blog/index.php?file=2005_04.xml&id=20022237">rash</a>, that was being unfair to myself: both decisions were made after many weeks of deliberation.



Kinda forgot about my "On Web Design" "series" ...<a href="http://danielsjourney.com/blog/index.php?file=2005_03.xml&id=29104609">part one</a>.



The reason <a href="http://danielsjourney.com/blog/index.php?file=2005_04.xml&id=07152444">SWIM was so delayed</a> was because a lot of deliberate decisions were made, then iteratively re-made; code written and rewritten and yet to be rewritten some more...what has actually been released as version 1.0 (now a 1.01 emergency bug-fix release) is actually the fifth version...the version that still runs this web site is a combination of the second and third.



A minor observation I've made is that the cool kids (i.e. <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">basecamp</a>, etc.) just put out the good goods first/fast/etc.



So if <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/04/google-maps-and-user-experience">it is the experience that makes the difference</a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/veen?m=196">*</a>, why are the <a href="http://myspace.com/">most popular social software service</a> and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">most popular blogging software</a> both crappy user experiences?



Suddenly I'm still not in the mood to make any conclusions. More later...
