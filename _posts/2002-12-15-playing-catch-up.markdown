			<a href="./integration">Updated integration.danielsjourney just now</a>; would love any feedback of at least a 1:1 love:hate ratio.



The name SWM has stuck on me, but the "widget" part has never really pegged it for me; widget normally refers to a piece of hard(ware), not soft(content), product. I was thinking about Simple Whut-whut Mover, making it a huge inside-joke around my favorite <a href="http://www.triggerhappytv.com">Trigger Happy TV</a> bit. Need that bit on mp3. (catch hint anyone :)
