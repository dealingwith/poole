I noticed [this post from 2008]({{site.baseurl}}/2008/01/05/anitsocial-networking.html) the other day, and the original post it links to was so far ahead of its time it is almost unbelievable. [Adam Greenfield](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Adam_Greenfield) is apparently [full-time book writing](https://www.amazon.com/Adam-Greenfield/e/B001H6SA1C/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1) these days, but his blog was one of the bests back in the day. From the [original post](https://speedbird.wordpress.com/2007/12/09/antisocial-networking/):

> For all of these reasons, I believe that technically-mediated social networking at any level beyond very simple, local applications is fundamentally, and probably persistently, a bad idea. From where I stand, the only sane response is to keep our conceptions of friendship and affinity from being polluted by technical metaphors and constraints to begin with.

> I understand that this is very much a minority opinion, and one which will not carry the day. But neither is it simply the knee-jerk, reactionary rejection of technology; I see it as a demand, rather, that we use information technology for the things it’s good at, and keep it far, far from the things it damages at first touch. I feel far too strongly about my friends and about the experiences we’ve shared, and which I cherish, to submit any of them to the idiot regime of social networking as it is currently understood.

Resubscribing to [his blog](https://speedbird.wordpress.com/) presently.
