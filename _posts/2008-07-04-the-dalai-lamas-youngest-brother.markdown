[TOKYOMANGO: My Interview with the Dalai Lama's Youngest Brother][1]:

> Tendzin Choegyal is the Dalai Lama’s youngest brother. Aside from being
related to one of the holiest persons alive, TC is a rebellious soul who
dropped out of college, spent a couple of years as a paratrooper in the
Tibetan contingency of the Indian army, survived alcoholism,and found peace
through a blend of Buddhism, lithium, and reading the news on the Internet.
When I met him at his home in Dharamsala, India—the Himalayan town that houses
the Tibetan government-in-exile—we talked about reincarnation, war movies,
Steven Seagal’s crazy outfits, and the preservation of Tibetan culture.

The following is a reprint of my interview with Choegyal, published in Issue
52 of Giant Robot magazine. A feature-length profile will be in the Fall issue
of Buddhadharma, which goes to press in July.
