[Search Features][1]

> Synonym Search: If you want to search not only for your search term but also
for its synonyms, place the tilde sign (~) immediately in front of your search
term.

Fill in the Blank: Sometimes the best way to ask a question is to get Google
to ‘fill in the blank’ by adding an asterisk (*) at the part of the sentence
or question that you want finished into the Google search box.
