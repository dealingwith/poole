There's the music that we talk about And music that we like There's music that
we love And music that we fake But then there is music More present than air
There is music we breathe A lifelong love affair

They might say We deserve each other They might say We shouldn't have our
druthers They might say Windscaping the topography They might say Reading
their own biography But I say I have a lot to learn about love I just might
have a lot to learn about love
