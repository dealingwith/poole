[Vital Interactive Media-Alternate Reality][1]

> In addition to music and audio, VIM is also involved in the development of
dynamic media experiences known as pervasive 'alternate reality' games.


In these types of games, a dynamic online world is created, consisting of
multiple websites, interactive characters, live phone numbers, emails, phone
calls to the players, instant messages and realworld clues. It's the job of
the player to follow clues, respond to realtime challenges, and solve puzzles
to progress in the story.


This is a very new, cutting edge genre that has attracted the press as well as
earned an interested player base in the hundreds of thousands, with more
interested every day. Gaming experiences have effectively been used for
promoting games, films and television shows, as well as for corporate
teambuilding and training.


The experience can provide additional story elements, run parallel to an
existing storyline, or stand completely on its own, all the while building
momentum and gaining the attention of players in a variety of demographic
markets as well as the press.


With an effective stealth launch and no 'official' tie-in admitted to by
anyone, the mystery of what's going on adds to the fun and addiction for the
players. In addition, this air of mystery inevitably leads to media coverage,
as well.
