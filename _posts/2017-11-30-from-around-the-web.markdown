["Definitely Not Trying to Fit In" with Tobias van Schneider](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/035-tobias-van-schneider-of-semplice)

IndieHackers.com podcast.

> Tobias is one of those rare people who's been successful over and over again. Whenever that's the case, there are also lots of failures behind the scenes. I think in this conversation, you get a really clear picture of both sides of that equation.

> It's also really illuminating to see so many of Tobias's stories back to back. If you pay close attention, you can pick up on a few patterns for how he thinks about the world that help explain why so many of the things he does end up working out.

[The Internet Is Dying. Repealing Net Neutrality Hastens That Death.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/technology/internet-dying-repeal-net-neutrality.html)

> The internet is dying.

> Sure, technically, the internet still works. Pull up Facebook on your phone and you will still see your second cousin's baby pictures. But that isn't really the internet. It's not the open, anyone-can-build-it network of the 1990s and early 2000s, the product of technologies created over decades through government funding and academic research, the network that helped undo Microsoft's stranglehold on the tech business and gave us upstarts like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix.

> Nope, that freewheeling internet has been dying a slow death — and a vote next month by the Federal Communications Commission to undo net neutrality would be the final pillow in its face.

[Daniel Kahneman: Why We Contradict Ourselves and Confound Each Other](https://onbeing.org/programs/daniel-kahneman-why-we-contradict-ourselves-and-confound-each-other-oct2017/)

On Being podcast.

> With his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman emerged as one of the most intriguing voices on the complexity of human thought and behavior. He is a psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in economics for helping to create the field of behavioral economics. He is a self-described "constant worrier." And it's fun, helpful, and more than a little unnerving to apply his insights into why we think and act the way we do in this moment of social and political tumult.

[Mark Zuckerberg invents revolutionary new foundation called "government"](https://kottke.org/17/11/mark-zuckerberg-invents-revolutionary-new-foundation-called-government)

> The genius founder of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has announced an inspiring new foundation to which he and his wife will donate huge amounts of their fortune in a bid to defeat all disease over the next century.

> "It's called the government," said Mr. Zuckerberg. "For such a long time I've been pondering how I can make a real difference with the enormous fortune I've amassed by concocting clever tax structures that minimise any tax liability from my firm.

> "Imagine my shock when it turned out that this ‘government' is devoted to ending disease. Not only that, it also has side projects dedicated to running schools, hospitals, a road system, parks, a national infrastructure, and lots of other worthy projects which make this planet a decent place to live.

> I'm proud to announce that I'll be giving lots of money to the ‘government', as I've decided to call it, and I fully expect to get a lot of really fantastic publicity out of it."
