We have boob jobs and nose jobs and fat suctions which dishonest doctors will perform on you for great cost and tremendous pain to your personal physical being, we have people getting silicone poisoning and disfigured as "unfortunate side effects" of these unnecessary procedures, and we have plastic surgery addicts who will never be happy with their body <i>ever</i>, no matter what somebody says or does to it.
