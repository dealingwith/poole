> Amniotics spilt, and semiotics rupture; There are no words, just raw screams
and suckles. Child of God, child of man - no difference: New life is unmoored
emotion, a wide sea of tears and sick, one desire: to feed, to gather more, be
mother-close.

But God won't stay.

Controlled crying. Separation an immediate fact post-partum: we must learn to
settle ourselves and enjoy the moments we have together. Foretastes of another
rupture to come, a larger curtain rent, another cry of pain when we'll be
thrown down into Mother's hands, never to leave them.
