[Rapha Gentlemen's Race - Sept. 6th, 2008][1] from [RAPHA][2] on [Vimeo][3].

[Pictures and write-up at the Rapha site][4]

I can't afford a stitch of their (probably exquisitely comfortable) clothing,
but I love what Rapha is doing in the culture. Neither hipster-fixie or ego-
racing, they represent most of what made me fall in love with cycling in 1989.
The team I rode on from junior high into college was a fairly hardscrabble set
of honest central PA gentlemen and ladies. My three favorite memories from
that time are:

  1. [The Harrisburg-Gold Mine loop][5]. Gold Mine was the most feared climb
in the area. Short but ridiculously steep. The descent down the north side
started like the first big hill on your favorite roller coaster (but with a
sharp right, right at the beginning) that dropped you into about a two mile
long dead-straight descent where speeds over 60 mph were common. The loop was
about 80 miles total, if I remember correctly.

  2. After three hours of play races (6-9pm every Thursday) at [Rossmoyne
Park][6]--scratch races, points races, miss-and-outs, you name it--sitting on
the park bench outside of the Camp Hill 7-11 drinking [Slurpees][7] (best
recovery drink ever) and talking into the night.

  3. After a few hours of winter training on the mountain bikes at [Lambs
Gap][8]--back then there weren't mountain bike trails, you just rode the
motocross and hiking trails--defrosting in my coach's Vanagon (which had the
most kick-ass heater ever) as snow began to fall.

I get super nostalgic for those days. By the time I was most of the way
through college, bicycle racing had started to be more the domain of the
overcompensating and asinine. The non-sanctioned races common in the 80's and
early 90's had been litigiously pushed out of existence, and even mountain
bike racing was becoming the domain of the Very Serious Athlete instead of
just an excuse to drink beer while riding a bike.
