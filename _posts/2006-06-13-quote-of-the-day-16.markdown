_Startups are marginal. They're started by the poor and the timid; they begin
in marginal space and spare time; they're started by people who are supposed
to be doing something else; and though businesses, their founders often know
nothing about business. Young startups are fragile. A society that trims its
margins sharply will kill them all._ [#][1]
