[The Living Room][1] is about the coolest thing I've seen all month. From [6
Angry Men][2]:

> ...we use the sound, light and temperature as input. We use an [Arduino][3]
– which is an open-source electronics prototyping platform – to measure the
light and temperature. Arduino can sense the environment by receiving input
from a variety of sensors...


The state of your living room is projected on your wall. The wall gets filled
by organisms that live there in an abstract world. The wall is their habitat.
So if it’s dark and there is no sound, some creatures will fall asleep.


[![][4]][4]


If your room becomes more noisy, the organisms will wake up irritated because
there’s no light and they want to sleep. Each organism has 9 different
conditions, which condition you will see depends of the balance between light
and sound. It’s a living wallpaper.
