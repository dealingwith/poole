> Radiohead just released a new video for its song "House of Cards" from the
album "In Rainbows".

No cameras or lights were used. Instead two technologies were used to capture
3D images: Geometric Informatics and Velodyne LIDAR. Geometric Informatics
scanning systems produce structured light to capture 3D images at close
proximity, while a Velodyne Lidar system that uses multiple lasers is used to
capture large environments such as landscapes. In this video, 64 lasers
rotating and shooting in a 360 degree radius 900 times per minute produced all
the exterior scenes.
