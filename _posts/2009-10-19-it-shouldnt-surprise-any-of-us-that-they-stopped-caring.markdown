> Our industry has collectively taught average people over the last few
decades that computers should be feared and are always a single misstep from
breaking. We’ve trained them to expect the working state to be fragile and
temporary, and experience from previous upgrades has convinced them that they
shouldn’t mess with anything if it works. They’ve learned to ignore our
pressures to always get the latest versions of everything because our upgrades
frequently break their software and workflow. They expect unreliable
functionality, shoddy software workmanship, unnecessary complexity, broken
promises from software marketers, and degrading hostility from their office’s
IT staff.

From the frequently brilliant [Marco Arment][1].
