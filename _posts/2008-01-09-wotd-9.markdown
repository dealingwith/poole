OMGBBQ [cotton][1]..._as a verb_! As seen [in this article][2]

> Sosnay's review found Zier's red ascot - which matched the handkerchief in
the breast pocket of Zier's pinstriped gray suit - "borders on contemptuous,"
given the judge's prior warnings that he only **cottons to** neck- and bow-
ties.

It would be oh-so groan-worthy if it wasn't _so good_.
