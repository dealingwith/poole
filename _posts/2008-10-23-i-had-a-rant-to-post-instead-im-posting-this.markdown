If there is injustice in my hands, If I have rewarded evil to my friend, Or
have plundered him who without cause was my adversary, Let the enemy pursue my
soul and overtake it; And let him trample my life down to the ground And lay
my glory in the dust

He who walks with integrity, and works righteousness, And speaks truth in his
heart. He does not slander with his tongue, Nor does evil to his neighbor, Nor
takes up a reproach against his friend

Though they intended evil And devised a plot, They will not succeed

Do not drag me away with the wicked And with those who work iniquity, Who
speak peace with their neighbors, While evil is in their hearts
