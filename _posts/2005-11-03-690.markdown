Wow. This ended up being rather prophetic. Those nightmares turned out not to
be from the book. They were just my spirit bending time, experiencing things
in the not-so-distant future. That now is my past.

_Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom by Cory Doctorow

the narrative does take you there, May 30, 2003

...Perhaps the scariest thing about this universe Cory created was the cold
indifference such a utopia can create. I had the three worst dreams I've ever
had in my life, three nights in a row during the time I was reading this book.
Coincidence?

What would really happen in a world where we have objectified an emotion into
the economy and eliminated death? It may not be as utopian and Cory would make
it out to be._
