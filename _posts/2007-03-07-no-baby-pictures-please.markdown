[No baby pictures, please - Los Angeles Times][1]:

> I'M A DECENT FRIEND: I'm happy when you're happy, sad when you're sad,
thrilled when your career isn't going better than mine.

So when you have a child — or more accurately in Los Angeles, twins — I'm
overjoyed that you got to experience the miracle of fertility treatments. But
I don't want you to e-mail me your baby pictures.

...and it goes on with witty gem after witty gem...
