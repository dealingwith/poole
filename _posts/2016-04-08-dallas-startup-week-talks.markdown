I am participating in a panel and a talk during Dallas Startup Week next week, both on Wednesday. First, the talk:

### Delicious processed development

From the talk description:

> **A development process that works**

> How does a startup implement a practical yet lightweight development process? What are the right things to learn from agile methodologies and which ones aren't really worth it for small startup teams? What tools are available to facilitate this process? Two senior developers from Modern Message, a local SaaS startup in the multifamily industry, answer these questions and more from their experience and stories of success and failures

I will be presenting alongside Modern Message's senior developer, [Sean Linsley](https://twitter.com/seanlinsley), who I have had the pleasure of working with for over two and a half years. We will explain why a solid software development process is important and describe Modern Message's own methodology for shipping great product. The talk is 1pm on the **70th** Floor of the Bank of America building, 901 Main St, Dallas.

The panel:

> **Startups 101: Finding a technical co-founder**

> Does this sound like you: Business guy looking for technologist to start next groundbreaking idea? Hear from a panel of tech cofounders and startup CTOâ€™s about what you need to be doing, thinking about, researching, etc., to attract the caliber of talent your startup will require.

I'm on the panel with two much more qualified persons than myself, Ross Bates of [Keyring](https://keyringapp.com/) and Christopher St. John of [Panamplify](http://panamplify.com/). The panel is 10am at Kowork, 400 North St. Paul St. No. 900, Dallas.
