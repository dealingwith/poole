![][1]

I had to write a bio for a show I'm in tonight. This is what I came up with:

> Daniel Miller is an information artist primarily interested in creating
narratives by manipulating objects (somatic or virtual images, sounds, etc.)
with code (social, neurological, or binary).

[sarjanemixalot][2] didn't like it, but it pretty much encapsulates everything
I do and is very helpful as I try to get my bearings again about why on earth
I'm existing.

and...it worked. I was in the zone from 9-something until 5am last night. I
mastered the [Flickr API][3] in just a couple lines of code thanks to
[phpFlickr][4]. I found another open source class that's like a mini Photoshop
in PHP. (Well, if Photoshop had like 4 commands that you had to call from teh
[command line][5].) My only frustration was trying to recreate some javascript
GUI goodness that I've (mostly) done before. We hate javascript. And the fact
that I can't run this thing on my server because it does not at present allow
remote file opening (i.e. images sitting on Flickr). So you'll have to come to
[3601 Routh Street][6] tonight at 7ish to see it. Assuming I can get it
installed. :P
