			<a href="http://www.nuwance.com/newsmonkey/">pretty cul</a>. i still haven't put up my new categorized newsreader. <s>i'm sooo lazy!</s> actually the news reader is really just for when i'm away from my desktop newsreader. if anyone uses it bookmark it, because i'm going to take it off the navigation, unless there are objections. i had big big plans for its customization etc. etc. but it just isn't worth it..it was a great learning device for me but now somewhat redundant.



<b>Update</b>: Uploaded the 'new' <a href="syndicates.php">news reader</a>. Have more feeds still I could put in there, but that again will have to be later...
