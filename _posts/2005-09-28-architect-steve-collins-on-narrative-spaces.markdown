> it occurs to me that [designersblock][1] can be thought of as ['just because
you're in the kitchen...'][2] in action - just change the captions.


like i said somewhere in the photo album, it reminded me of the installations
of the 90s such as [HG][3] and [self storage][4]. a warehouse in a decaying
part of town, wondering whether you're at the right address, trying to find
the actual entrance; following a trail through a musty warehouse or cellar,
wondering whether what you find is art or just left by squatters... i learned
that narrative was more important than technical polish; that discovery and
lack of explanation were good; that time should be taken to gather meaning...
so all this prepared me for alt worship.


except alt worship is still mostly too tidy and too church. we should be in
warehouses. or _ruined_ churches.


and then it would be an event, not a 'church service'. so you'd run it  every
day for a month, and then do nothing for six. forget all this 'how do you do
it every week' nonsense. why would you want to go every week, if you're going
to remember it for ten years after one visit, like art?

from [his blog][5]. [his main site][6] is a wealth of original content on such
matters.
