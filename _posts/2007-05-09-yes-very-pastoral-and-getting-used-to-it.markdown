eh. edit.

Well, now that THAT'S out of the way....Today I moved two truckfulls of mulch
and felt very pastoral. You can see a lot of stars at night. And I rode around
43 miles in 2.5hrs in a group of about 10-20 (it split a few times). The roads
were smooth and the air cool and I haven't pushed myself physically like that
in about a decade. It feels purreety good...although it won't tomorrow when
I'm supposed to go on another ride. And Thurs, yoga! And next monday, massage!
(Did I mention [I had the best massage evar yesterday][1]?)
