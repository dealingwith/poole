[![][1]][2]I've been working on [danielsjourney][3] some more lately, unhappy
as I was with the [last header][4], we've disposed of the graphic altogether
in deference to a print-like masthead. Also moved some links and took the
twitter feed out and just stuck the latest tweet in said header. I worked on
the content for [/design][5], and really need to work on the rest of the areas
of the site as well. The whole thing's been in flux too long.

Oh, and the damn thing still doesn't look right in Internet Explorer. I refuse
to spend any more time bending over for that godforsaken browser, though.
