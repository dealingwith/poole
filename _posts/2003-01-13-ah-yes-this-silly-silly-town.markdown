<i>Bitter brew? For the past couple of weeks, those wags at Kramerbooks n Afterwords Cafe in Dupont Circle have been marketing a beverage called the "Trent Lotte." The menu describes the 3.25 item as "separate but equal parts of coffee and milk" - a not too veiled reference to Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott's career-damaging 100th-birthday praise of fellow Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond's segregationist 1948 presidential campaign. Yesterday bartender Mark Kutcher told us that the coffee and steamed milk are served in two different containers, and it's up to customers to integrate them. "We think it's really funny," Kutcher said. "That's why we do it." But we seriously doubt if Lott is laughing. Our call to the deposed Senate Republican leader's press office yesterday was greeted by grim silence.</i>
