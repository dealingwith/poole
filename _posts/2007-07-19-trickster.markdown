Yesterday I had my copy of Trickster Makes This World returned to me after
about a year. (The borrower did not read it.) There's a link (in regards to
identity) between love/hate, community, and trickster that is on the tip of my
brain. I'm jotting this down mostly for myself so I don't have to take the
whole book with me on my trip(s). I have written a lot about trickster
[before][1] (most of it unavailable as my proper blog archives are down).

> In short, trickster is a boundary-crosser. Every group has its edge, its
sense of in and out, and trickster is always there, at the gates of the city
and the gates of life, making sure there is commerce. he also attends the
internal boundaries by which groups articulate their social life. We
constantly distinguish--right from wrong, sacred and profane, clean and dirty,
male and female, young and old, living and dead--and in every case trickster
will cross the line and confuse the distinction. Trickster is the creative
idiot, therefore, the wise fool, the gray-haired baby, the cross-dresser, the
speaker of sacred profanities. Where someone's sense of honorable behavior has
left him unable to act, trickster will appear to suggest an amoral action,
something right/wrong that will get life going again. Trickster is the mythic
embodiment of ambiguity and ambivalence, doubleness and duplicity,
contradiction and paradox.
