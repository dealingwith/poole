Some more really good Tim Ferriss podcasts:

[Tobi Lütke — From Snowboard Shop to Billion-Dollar Company](https://tim.blog/2019/02/07/tobi-lutke-shopify/). He's probably my favorite CEO at the moment.

[Caterina Fake — The Outsider Who Built Giants](https://tim.blog/2019/02/14/caterina-fake/).

> Cane che abbaia, non fa caccia

"The dog that barks doesn't hunt."

The book is really good.
