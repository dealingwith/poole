[Robert Gomez - On This Day][1]

![][2]

[NPR][3]:

> Notably, Pine Sticks and Phosphorous is the first of Gomez's LPs to be
recorded almost entirely in a professional studio. Though Gomez is technically
a "solo artist" and writes the songs, parts, and arrangements on his own, a
number of talented musicians join him on the record, including Sarah Jaffe,
and members of The Polyphonic Spree, Midlake, and Postmarks, giving Pine
Sticks and Phosphorous an impressive, full band sound.
