"We're all allowed a certain number of free passes for coming out human
beings."

"At first mis-read as '...coming out AS human beings,' which adds an
interesting twist...maybe not so many of us have done that.

> "I came out to the world yesterday!"

"Oh yeah? How did that go?! And: I had no idea! Wow!"

"Yeah, I know, I'm a HUMAN BEING and I'm PROUD!"

"And there could be those big coming out parties in the middle of campuses but
instead of a pink door it could be...a black door? ...Door color to be
furiously debated."

...

"I would marry Photoshop and have an affair with Google were that a
possibility. No. It would be the other way around. Definitely marry Google."
