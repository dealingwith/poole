I comment on "[Should There Be a Unified Set of Styles For Web
Interfaces?][1]":

> The main issue is that we need more voices for sanity in our web application
design. I think our current issues are natural growing pains from making an
application framework out of a technology originally created for documents.


I think you should contribute a sane voice...

This is something I've thought about writing about here, so just as good
someone else did and started a good conversation about it.
