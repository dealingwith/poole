![][1]_The idea of liquid modernity could be seen as Bauman's attempt to
resolve the tension that exists in much social theory between explaining
social phenomena as aspects of modernity, and accounting for their appearance
only recently. After all, the modern condition, with its overturning of
tradition, has dominated the past two centuries. Liquid modernity seems
perhaps to be the late realisation of a tendency that has characterised
modernity from the start. What remains at issue is whether the 'solid'
institutions of prior modernity were merely the residue of tradition, or
pointed towards a more enduring potential of modernity itself. Most
pertinently, is the rational self-determining subject of modernity any more
than an illusion that has had its day?_ [The trouble with being human these
