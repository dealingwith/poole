Miriam, after preparing potatoes and salad for dinner last night (it was yummy!): "Just poor people's food." Me: "Some of the poorest people I know have it the best!" (I was specifically thinking about her maternal grandparents.)




Miriam, today, while listening to Bob Marley (jokingly): "I always thought he said 'German' there." Me: "Cuz we're German we're German we're German we're German so I hope you like Germans too!"



Current Christmas mp3: <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artist_song/2961/2961379.html">What a Year for a New Year</a> by Dan Wilson of Semisonic, off of the collection <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/503/maybe_this_christmas.html">maybe this christmas</a> which also has songs by Coldplay, Ron Sexsmith, Sense Field, and Ben Folds.
