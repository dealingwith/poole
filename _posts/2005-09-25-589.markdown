_[Pour beer out on the curb for Olympic Recordings][1], one of my favorite
metal labels around, unfairly driven into parent-company absorption by the
Olympics. One rather sees the United States Olympic Committee's point:
certainly, every time I got out my copy of _Dechristianize_, I assumed I was
listening to Florida death metal that'd been vetted and approved by the USOC.
Didn't you, fellow death metal enthusiast? Didn't you call your Olympics-
lovin' relatives and tell them that, at long last, the Olympic games had a
metal label all their own? No? You didn't? You say the word "olympic" predates
the USOC by about four millenia if you go by its Greek root and by a mere four
centuries if you're going strictly by English usage? Huh. Imagine that. Next
thing you'll be saying that we shouldn't let biotech companies put patents on
rice or something, you big _communist_, you._ [#][2]
