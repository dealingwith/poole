"i dont really know what makes you think you have any kind of credentials to
be a beacon of pretension. anyone who so blindly believes in something is no
different than any other variety of fanaticism. anyone that pretentious at
your age needs a serious reality check. or maybe you just need an ego
suppository so you can shit some of it out of your ass, to go along with the
laissez faire crap you ejaculate out of your mouth."

"a jackhammer outside the open window" is a good band name.
