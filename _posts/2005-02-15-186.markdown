So I woke up from this bad dream this morning. It's already fading but it
really left me shaking.

It was just my parents, my one aunt and uncle, and I, having a conversation.
There's a lot of background stuff to understand here, but basically my aunt
and uncle were drilling me about what I was doing and IR and all that stuff.
Then they had this book that mentioned some software similar to Collection and
saying how I needed to write about my software in that way, but there was a
lot of cheesy ass shit in this book and then talk about judgement day etc. I
don't remember much else other than this really bad spirit of condemnation and
me defending myself a lot and breaking down in tears twice.

All of this to say, there's a reason I don't hang with fundie xians: PAST
EMOTIONAL TRAUMA.
