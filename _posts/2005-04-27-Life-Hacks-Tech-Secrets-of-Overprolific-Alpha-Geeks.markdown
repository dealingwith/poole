<blockquote><ul><li>nerds are often disorganized or have a twisted skein of attention-deficit issues</li>
<li>nerds love assessing, classifying, and defining the objects in their world</li>
<li>nerds crave actionable items and roll their eyes at "mission statements" and lofty management patois</li>
<li>nerds like things that work with technology-agnostic and lofi tools</li>
<li>nerds like frameworks but tend to ignore rules</li>
<li>nerds are unusually open to change (if it can be demonstrated to work better than what they're currently using)</li>
<li>nerds like fixing things on their own terms</li>
<li>nerds have too many projects and lots and lots of stuff</li></ul></blockquote>

"<a href="http://www.craphound.com/lifehacksetcon04.txt">All geeks have a todo.txt file</a>. They use texteditors (Word, BBEd, Emacs, Notepad) not Outlook or whathaveyou..."

<blockquote>What we keep in our todo is the stuff we want to forget



Geeks say they remember details well, but they forget their spouses' birthdays and the dry-cleaning. Because it's not interesting.



It's the 10-second rule: if you can't file something in 10 seconds, you won't do it. Todo.txt involves cut-and-paste, the simplest interface we can imagine.



...Power-users don't trust complicated apps. Every time power-geekshas had a crash, s/he moves away from it. You can't trust software unless you've written it -- and then you're just more forgiiving.



The private blog -- a secret blog, using a tool:



Brad Fitzpatrick of LiveJournal: 8 entries every 10 min are private. Closed off from everyone.



Announce stuff is moving into RSS -- email announcements to something that syndicates over RSS



--



Geeks write scripts to take apart dull, repetitive tasks. They'll spend 10h writing a script that will save 11h -- because writing scripts is interesting and doing dull stuff isn't.



Scripts are embarassingly coded, often forgotten."



People do lots of webscraping. Scrape stuff and turn it into RSS -- make your own feeds. JWZ uses this to help him run his bar.



Lots of people do this with banking services -- to keep an eye on their accounts.

People make utilities to make their stuff public. Not just blogs -- but stuff like Eric Raymond's "shipper" -- package a code into an RPM, upload to SourceForge, announce, etc.



Edd Dumbill: Ideas rot if you don't do something with them. Don't hoard them. I blog them or otherwise tell people.



This is a way to look organized, "That guy has lots of ideas, what a genius."



You only have to be right once -- people google for some idea and find your ramble about it and are impressed.



Making stuff public is like having your parents come to stay -- you clean everything up.

Those were some excerpts from <a href="http://www.craphound.com/">Doctorow</a>'s notes from <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2004/view/e_sess/4802">Life Hacks: Tech Secrets of Overprolific Alpha Geeks</a>:

<blockquote>Technologists consume Big-Gulp-loads of information, and write, code, and edit reams of output. Author Charlie Stross notes that he reads and digests more in his morning bookmarks than most literate 18th-century readers would process in a year.
