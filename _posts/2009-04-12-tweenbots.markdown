[Tweenbots][1]


> ...Tweenbots are human-dependent robots that navigate the city with the help
of pedestrians they encounter. Rolling at a constant speed, in a straight
line, Tweenbots have a destination displayed on a flag, and rely on people
they meet to read this flag and to aim them in the right direction to reach
their goal.


Given their extreme vulnerability, the vastness of city space, the dangers
posed by traffic, suspicion of terrorism, and the possibility that no one
would be interested in helping a lost little robot, I initially conceived the
Tweenbots as disposable creatures which were more likely to struggle and die
in the city than to reach their destination.


...The results were unexpected. Over the course of the following months,
throughout numerous missions, the Tweenbots were successful in rolling from
their start point to their far-away destination assisted only by strangers.
Every time the robot got caught under a park bench, ground futilely against a
curb, or became trapped in a pothole, some passerby would always rescue it and
send it toward its goal. Never once was a Tweenbot lost or damaged.


...The Tweenbot's unexpected presence in the city created an unfolding
narrative that spoke not simply to the vastness of city space and to the
journey of a human-assisted robot, but also to the power of a simple
technological object to create a complex network powered by human intelligence
and asynchronous interactions.
