<P>Check that about 60-80%, it must be categorized...</P>
<P><A href="http://www.fogcreek.com/CityDesk">This thing</A> does about 30% as far as final website functionality (the "article" is the only data type paradigm, and while you could work around it to make it work, it's just not particularly scalable), 60% as far as the desktop piece functionality, but the destop interface itself is really good (read intuitive). Also the 80 clam version is only up to 500 pages, then you have to get the 350 clam version! Yikees!</P>
