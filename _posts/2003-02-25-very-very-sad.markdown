<em>The American Booksellers Association reveals that 8 of 10 Americans neither bought nor read a book in 2002. Indeed, nearly 3 out of 5 Americans haven't opened a book since high school, and 42 percent of college graduates haven't read any book since they graduated.</em> (via <a href="http://www.jordoncooper.sk.ca/2003_02_01_archives.html#90373070">coop</a>)
