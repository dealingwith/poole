I had a conversation yesterday which wasn't weird or disturbing <em>per say</em>, but it did make me wonder about who's reading this blog and what they may think or do based on that reading (since I've been called a missionary and a diplomat in the past couple of months it's obvious things aren't clear or can be made up from the white space in between words).



I stopped talking about politics, whatever little talking I was doing about it anyway, last July when we moved to DC. My emotions and conscience, however, have still been a frequent topic; and, especially lately, said emotions and conscience have been troubled by {}.


But talking about it here doesn't help. So I'm not. Just go read <a href="http://theyblinked.com/blog/">theyblinked</a>.


While the world outside swarms around us I will be spending more time alone, looking inward and upward.


The time for begging leaders is over. It is time to beg God.
