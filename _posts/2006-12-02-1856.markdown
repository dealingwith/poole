Yesterday started off with my first mention in a [citywide daily][1].

Then there was a bunch of stuff.

Then [Art Con][2]. Despite [being in a bit of a mood for NO REASON][3] (truth
be told I know exactly why and have done nothing about it other than some
cognitive intervention {aka being rational}), I had a great time. I ran into
about 1,000,000 people I knew, grabbed a couple drinks, bid on about 4 pieces
(winning one) (including bidding $205 for one just to get the guy to at least
go to $210), talked talked talked talked, watched Salim play, took pictures of
Salim playing, then played the sleigh bells on stage with Salim at the end of
his set (I might have had a little to drink).

Hopefully some pictures later. I'm off to mix a record.
