[![][1]][2]

5. [Salim Nourallah][3] released [Constellation][4], [Ciphers][5] (edit: oops
that was actually the end of '08), produced [Rhett Miller][6], became a man
with a more-than-respectable catalog and further established himself as the
reigning godfather of Dallas music.

4. [Justin Terveen took photographs][7] and made Dallas look like a cool city
to live in. [Brock Davis][8] made amazing art every day of the year.

3. Old single women living alone in interesting houses. Particularly, Dallas'
own [Ronnie Claire Edwards][9] ([here is a street view of the property][10]--I
rode by it just the other day) and Pennsylvania's recently departed [Violet
Hobaugh][11] ([here are some pictures of her home][12]--Laura Kicey's
photographs are how I discovered this story, which takes place really close to
where I grew up--in fact I undoubtedly rode by her house a few times, 17 years
ago).

2. [_why's disappearance][13]. It's hard to describe _why's importance, but
you'll either get it or you won't (and no harm in the latter). Great places to
start: [his wikipedia page][14], [his book's wikipedia page][15], [_why the
lucky stiff interview on the setup][16], [a great _why quote and picture of
his book][17], and [a rather well written "eulogy to _why"][18] (by Javascript
guru John Resig).

1. Irony ate itself. Hipsters, as a cultural race, have mostly died off. Maybe
it didn't happen this year, maybe it hasn't really happened (and it's just my
perception), but it seems like a decent swath of our cultural tastemakers and
coolhunters looked around, took a deep breath, and realized they weren't
getting any younger and that the simple life can be good...
