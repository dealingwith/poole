> [Microsoft sees] things from more of a platform-and-capabilities
perspective, sometimes to a fault. At the opposite end of the spectrum, like
Apple with the iPod, that’s a scenario-based design. They start with the user
experience of listening to music and aim for the minimum necessary to
accomplish that experience. Microsoft’s culture is “Build it, and they will
come.” There are still a lot of people there who build technology that’s very
capable, but it isn’t packaged in such a way that people see the value of it.
