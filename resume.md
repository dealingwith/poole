# Daniel Miller

### Technology leader, educator, front-end designer and developer

I ship software. I am passionate about the craft of software development, with a focus on design, education and entrepreneurship. [email](mailto:dealingwith@gmail.com) / [blog](http://danielsjourney.com) / [github](https://github.com/dealingwith) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dealingwith/)

## Experience

### CTO, Modern Message
SaaS Product Development / 2013 to present

- I lead a team of 11 full-stack Ruby on Rails and front-end developers, UX designers and growth hackers.
- As the technology lead for the company, my responsibilities run the gamut...code, testing, infrastructure, technical strategy, security, product management, recruiting, developer happiness...
- I am particularly proud of the team I've helped to build and the agile development methodology we've established, as well as the data-driven design process we've employed.
- Manage the code for a large front-end Backbone application

### Cofounder, Minecraft U
Education / 2014 to present

- [Minecraft U](http://minecraftu.org/) focuses on teaching problem-solving and programming techniques in a safe, encouraging ecosystem centered around Minecraft.
- [View the curriculum](https://github.com/MinecraftU/mcu-curriculum).
- Read a little bit about the [product development camp](http://bit.ly/2aZpglW) I ran last summer.

### Cofounder, Extra Sauce
Digital Agency / 2011 to 2012

- At Extra Sauce I wore many hats: developer, designer, project manager, even business development lead and marketing strategist. As a small, agile product development and social strategy shop, they do it all. In terms of technology, it was almost exclusively thick-client web apps using REST, Javascript and HTML5, and libraries such as jQuery, Underscore and Backbone. Clients included Smirnoff, Coke and Lincoln.

### User Interface Developer, Collecta
Real-time Search / 2009 to 2011

- I was hired at Collecta to handle design, HTML, CSS & Javascript implementation. I designed & built the front-end for numerous applications: the main real-time search product as well as a widget, widget builder, spam training tool, destination site refresh & alternative widgets & white-label demos for the Wall Street Journal & MySpace. Total output was in the thousands of lines of markup, CSS & code represented in hundreds of git branches. Collecta’s applications required radical manipulations of the DOM─inserting multiple DOM elements per second─requiring frequent and advanced levels of jQuery performance tuning.

### User Interface Developer, D2SC Data Driven Software Corporation
Educational Software / 2008 to 2009

- At D2SC, I was responsible for the development and maintenance of the web-based component of D2SC's education software product. A Java app, the templates were in XSLT, a throwback to my days as a middleware consultant at Level 8 Systems. 

### User Interface Developer, Brink's Inc
Enterprise Software / 2005 to 2006

- At Brink's I was part of a small team that worked on software projects that supported other business units inside the company. I initially helped with the design and product development of these tools, later participating in the development effort in .NET.

### Founder, Integration Research
Nonprofit Technology Startup / 2003 to 2005

- I founded Integration Research as a nonprofit incubator for ideas, processes, and technologies that aid in artistry, personal creative process and community development. We developed software, partnered with other software developers, collected knowledge concerning the creative process and nurtured spaces both virtual and physical that facilitated various artistic communities.

### Freelance Web Developer
Various Projects / 2001 to 2003

- Freelance web design and writing. Web design customers included Island Water Sports, the biggest surf shop in Fort Lauderdale; and the USAID office in Sarajevo. Also participated as an author of "I Am Relevant" during this time.

### Middleware Consultant, Level 8 Systems
Enterprise Software / 1999 to 2001

- Wrote training materials for all Level 8 middleware products
- Co-wrote the book "MSMQ From Scratch"
- Delivered training worldwide

## Education
